drug dealer chic

avant que l'on s'attache avant que l'on se gache
deal with the outcome a strap in the hand
okay i don't remember where we first met
as i look around they don't do it like my clique
i'ma drown in some poison abusin' my limit
they were the foes of society whether fighting the local sheriff or a secret agent
so much hate i need a ak ak
sit down drank stand up drank
cut the crap far as rap
had to tighten it up like the drells and archie bell
car door opens and gunshots are fired
dip make a nigga flip
no one can judge

rock foreverbut just turned thirty
and only cosign what radio does

gyeah cocaine weed
and when you hold me like that
and i'm all up all up all up in the bank with the funny face
block a nigga in
fuckin' with my clique
then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
bust this like a cold milk from out the toilet
a light in the dark shining your love into my life
yes no villain metal face to destro
so why send oppression not blessings
own his own throne the boss like king koopa
but then they'd always seemed right
head of the class and she just won a swallowship

knocking no answer slow dancer hopeless romancer dopest flow stanzas
off sides like how worf rides with starfleet
aha got them niggas kdot you good
there were moments of gold
i bet she tried to say she gave me her all she played ball
madvillain dashing in a beatrhyme crime spree
 to a half a million ain't nothin' nobody can do with me

and the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa
my homeboy just dome'd a nigga
you might as well not ask him for no free shit capiche
that white frost on that pound cake

i am risking my life to tell you with great concern that i must warn you
so tell me why shouldn't it be true

a constant regretter
sippin' bubbly feelin' lovely livin' lovely
they talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen the justice
que le temps d'avant c'tait le temps d'avant
that's how these niggas so onetrackminded
strange fruit hangin' from the poplar trees
he's in the lab on some old buddha monk shit
you cannot mess with the light
only gin and tang
i weighs it up that's real money
i can admit that it did look like yours
by myself
you don't want her don't waste her time i'll dupe her
it's terrible
but then she has a sexy voice sound like jazzy joyce
that the time before was the time before
bound to fall in love
 cause i was him i would have married kate and ashley
to the spiritual my spirit do know better but i told him
that it's all coming back to me
and we gon' crash it when nobody's home

when you tried your first molly
real nigga in my dna
and never ever wake up
when i was led to you
to a place where we'll be safe
y'all don't know that don't shit phase me
it's a intricate plot of a bboy strap

ever since ten eleven glad she made a brethren
the only thing we had to free our mind
now i done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
fat motherfucker now look who's in trouble
they don't know
all she need is some bill money
i don't compromise i just penetrate
that sounds great shorty girl's a trooper
a couple driveby's in the hood lately shit
seem like the whole city go against me
i wave a few bottles then i watch 'em all flock
when you figure out you're gonna need someone
can you help me underst 
like sitting on twenty threes to get the squealers grinning
watch the droptop papi
when he shine with thehe's a rhinestone
attract heavy cash 'cause the game's centrifugal
how you gon' lie to the lawyer
nel cuore rester
sometimes our happiness is captured
and sleepin' in a villa
if i quit this season i still be the greatest funk
and i know just know just know just
you have been my inspiration
where your grandma stay huh my nigga
i was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
we know we need it

a herb tried to slide with four and five and got caught
overthrow 'em like throwing rover a biscuit
this is bugged out man niggas is snitching
i call her thunder thighs with the fatty swolla
even though there may be times
food we need food
i've been bending backwards till i'm broke
made me an angel on angel dust what
every second every minute
the bugle has blown fi many times
yeah i'm talkin' bossy i ain't talkin' kelis
in all quad flavors lord save us
can you use these tears to put out the fires in my soul
ain't no peace treaty just piecin' bgs up to preapprove
a rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical
lost is how i'm feeling lying in your arms
and you know it like a poet like baby doll
if i forgive you all that

used to wear flip flops now rare gear coppers
stuck a flag in my city everybody's screamin' compton

i swore i wouldn't tell but most of y'all sharing bars
it's like i don't even know ya
uhhuh that's your heartbeat
born inside the beast my expertise checked out in second grade
watching all these dreams go up in smoke
sit down hol' up hol' up lil' hol' up lil' bitch
i can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
it's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
iiiii'm in that twoseat lambo swerve believe
diamond in the ceilin' marble on the floors
rain rain pourin' pourin'
but i just wanna design hotels and nail it
when i wason cell motel we didn't have nowhere to stay

what's cracking boy same ol' shit kid
rapping and dancing like red head kingpin
during tornado time with no coat than i caught ya
let's make it so free and the bars so hard
minutes turn to hours days to years then gone
in the streets with a heater under my dungarees
i was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
a rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous
i bought the big one to prove it
it's been racin' since the summertime
and i'd look at you like this shit gravy
the funk shall be within you gunshot
close but no krills toast for po' nils post no bills
i know that you anointed show me how to overcome
i'll change myself into gold for you to still love me
informer keep it up and get tested
other help
fell on my face and awoke with a scar
he was sobbin' he was mobbin' way belligerent and drunk
and when i touch you like that
beat it up like rampage
told you that i'm on the way
crowd around
what you holdin' it for
your dna an abomination
doin' clothes you woulda thought i had help
told him tell her they stole ithe told her he lost it
uh ladies and gentlemen
i laugh in my head
and lay down the g like luther everything'll be super
you are the one who held me up
weirdo brown skin'ded always kept his hair low
far across the distance
but i know this much is true
telling e'rything e'rything
overproof drunk shit but who'd'a thunk it
but ever since that day i was lookin' at him different
shit i've been through prolly offend you this is paula's oldest son
with your girl she tryna jerk me woah believe
you know we need it
dogs he got it like new powers
and it's all coming back to me
knock it off ben
leave him in the wilderness
we're heading for something
treat the demons just like pam
running up they mouth bill everybody doubting still
then they talk about me
and i get bleach on my tshirt
put it in the air come here kiss it
out with the moolah i let her get a outfit
once more you open the door
bitch where was you when i was walkin'
cause i can't leave it to you
so i ball so hard mothafuckas wanna fine me
phantom of the grand ole opry ask the dumb hottie

at the same burger stand where beep hang out
love villain take pride in code words
why you resent every making of this
i got this girl and she wants me to duke her

or your brother's the one that you're running from
goblin ghoul a zombie with no conscience
and show me why you deserve to have it all
