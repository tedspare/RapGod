You old Petey Pablo take your shirt off
Wave round your head like a helicopter

All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from
Yeezy said he aint make them
My niggas chasin bounty hunters
And gettin chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea
Big yacht no power steering
Aye aye captain

School of hard knocks

Verse  Lil Wayne
I got problems bigger than these boys
My deposits they be on steroids
Lord free the Carter niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin everything I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up I got this sewed up my soda poured up
My woes up Im flippin those bucks they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down toes up
Hold up get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on put my goons on they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch I buy a new arm you lukewarm
Im Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes just their robes
Half a milli in the safe another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you What you were thinkin
What you thought it was
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon be some crazy Weezy fans waitin in the lobby
Mula baby
Chorus Chance The Rapper
You dont want no problem want no problem with me bih
You dont want no problem want no problem with me

Pull up inside a huggy Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour Ill ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling fuck me
Two weeks shell be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy Tommy and Chuckie
And Chuck E Cheeses pizzas Jesus pieces sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddys yall taught me how to go hunting BLAM

Verse  Vic Mensa
I will smoke a little something but I dont inhale
Everywhere that I go everywhere they be asking hows it going
Say the goings well go figure Victors light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell all praise to the God
God knows hes a pro hes a pro like COINTEL
Check check mate check me take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldnt kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days they get so high
Burn trees smoke chlorophyll til they cant feel shit
Shitfaced faced it  hits on this L
Elevated train and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill miseducated my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad enough of that jazz
Asshole absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet Ice cubes in a bong
Rip brain dead take a tug and then pass

Verse  Twista
I could make a flow pitter patter with a patter pitter  juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
Thats the new principle sometimes Imma be about some hoes
Sometimes Imma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast Im the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
Cause Im addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me Im the ObiWan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like Im offa codeine low key
Dont be so judgmental even though Im reminiscing
If I dont know what I miss is
Ima end up figuring out that its home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and Im thanking
I need em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug and I cant cause Im stanking
Never too old for a spanking IGH
Chorus  Vic Mensa
Cigarettes on cigarettes my momma think I stank

With the big wide windows with the suicide doors
Aint no blood on my money aint no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isnt close aint no visitin Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
Im at war with my wrongs Im writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited Im a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
Im feeling shortness of breath so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water ugh

I got my city doing front flips
When every father mayor rapper jump ship
I guess thats why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets so my daughter can have somewhere to play
Im the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I aint goin to hell or to Hillman
Igh Igh Igh Igh for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Cant stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous you dont know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man I dont even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Dosido
Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

Verse
Kicked off my shoes tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatchless necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah I inhaled who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young just turned older than him
I seen it happen I seen it happen I see it always
He still be screaming I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And Im hungry Im just not that thirsty
As of late all my verses seem not so versey
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back like Thats not your jersey
Stressin pullin my hair out hoping I dont get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I dont get sick
Making all of this money hoping I dont get rich
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth dont rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls is that appealing to you
From your cubicle desktop what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Couldve threw him an alleyoop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vics still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that antiviolence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And Im only getting greedier
And Im still Mr Youmedia
And I still cant find Talent
And Im still choosing classmates that wouldnt fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks Im good enough
And Mama Jan still dont take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face
Outro
I am a new man I am sanctified
Oh I am holy I have been baptized
I have been born again I am the White Light

Verse  Chance The Rapper
We used to roll at the Rink we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much you used to know everything
You couldnt stand me I couldnt stand you
You said Im steady playin but you steady playin too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place
But in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me too worried bout Frooties and Chews
Til I found out all the shawdys with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

I mean its just dancing

Then I put my waist through your hips
And your legs and my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor

Verse  Tyler the Creator
The big eared bandit is tossin all his manners
In a bag and wrappin them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says Catch up nigga it looks like an accident
Um flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like shes been mimicking a panda
Its the dark skinned nigga kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic contradicting dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semenscented cheetah printed tee
In that Preme five panel Ill repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normalass past like I cheated on my team
Its me Tried to get that nigga but Golf Wang
See he did come back though
Verse  Hodgy Beats
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin you own your opponent is a defeatin bonus
Im Zeus to a Kronos cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin
Im on my Robin Hood shit robbing in the hood
Whips drugs jewels and your pet Im stealin your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette soldiers lace the fuckin boot
And salute like the troop when they shoot you gon brrrooop
Its KILLHodgy nigga stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my KoolAid Juice
Verse  Left Brain
Whats up bitch
Hodgy got the juice I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny my nigga we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel

You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup uh and her ass fat
Dont be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga Im tryna smoke bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame Talking bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you dont salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia bitch dont get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up throw em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl yo I dont really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus
Verse  Mike G
What the fuck is caution
Often I leave em flossing in KAWS exes next to coffins
Lost in translation the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
Thats great Im home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees huh
Im getting blazed thinking bout those days
I had the top off the GT like toupees
One finger in the air alls fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you dont even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham rock LA to Harlem
If you say Get em Mike G then I got em
One man squadron nigga Im a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or its gonna be real
OF til I OD and I probably will uh
Verse  Domo Genesis
Its still Mr SmokeaLottaPot get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop do I love her Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin drop
Bitch Im in the zone stand alone like Macaulay Cock
Ive been runnin blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now Im all grown same song just a different waltz
Fire what I talk but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit your mistress on my hit list
And Im lifted til Im stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin area
Blood clots give me five feet fore I bury ya
Suicide flow let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team ho nigga wassup
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog Im a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short break it down couple pounds roll it up
Interlude Frank Ocean
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
Right right
Verse  Frank Ocean
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends smoke a gram of that haze
Bro easy on the ounce thats a lot for a day
But just enough for a week my nigga what can I say
Im high and Im bi wait I mean Im straight
Imma get you this wine the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time Morris and Day
Course you know the vibes just as fly as the rhymes
On the song cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Interlude Jasper Dolphin
Goddammit this rapping is stupid and its hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go
Verse  Jasper Dolphin
Hey its Jasper not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show so I guess Im an actor
Pot head halfbaked lookin like Chappelle
Rollin up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang nigga so I still dont give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat
Interlude Jasper Dolphin & Earl Sweatshirt
Hah nigga came through with a bar real quick
Just for the bitches little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it Wolf Gang
Yeah fuck that
Verse  Earl Sweatshirt
Look for contrast heres a pair of lips
Swallowin sarapin and settin fire to sheriffs whips
Whoops whoops Fuckin AllAmerican terrorist
Crushin rapper larynx to feed em a fuckin carrot stick
And me I just spent a year Ferrisin
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow tight line might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit grimey get dinero type
Feral fuckin illapparelwearin pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin fridges tippin over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixtyday chips from fuckin awesome anonymous
Call him bloated til he show em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin hot as dunkin scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada drivin drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova Im rollin over the novices
And roamin through the forest and spittin cold as his porridge is
Stay gold til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again lord of lips
Bored of this forklift the tippy top best under  list
Stormin the gate ensurin the bass
Scorchin leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me we savages half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who dont give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact your swagger is tacky
So see me you cant like Crunchy Black catchin a taxi
Uh back like lateral passin
With that motherfuckin gladiator manner of rappin
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi please
Verse  Tyler the Creator
OF shit thats all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin down Fax Wolf Gang run the fuckin block
Storefront knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape and my shoes
Um I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later for our label yeah we own it
I started an empire I aint even old enough
To drink a fucking beer Im tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggas in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the nword
And the ones that got called weird fag bitch nerd
Cause you was into jazz kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we aint actin right
Always try to turn our fuckin color into black and white
But theyll never change em never understand em
Radicals my anthem turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin bein mad as fuck
Just admit not only are we talented were rad as fuck bitches

Where your ass was at dog when niggas tried to run off
Where your ass was at dog You made me pull this gun out
Where your ass was at dog when I was in the Pyrex
Where your ass was at dog when I was drinking HiTech
Where your ass was at dog You came through the projects
Where your ass at We keep that fully loaded contracts
Had her rain dance on the dick ass jumping
Running through the pussy like a nigga going jogging
Fuck a little Louis put it in a bitch pocket
Put a pic with me on the gram now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store
Had to struggle to get where Im at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke
Gas rolling up in the blunt Amoco
 tryin come in the spot to open up the dope
Burglar bar doors got a young nigga confident
Juugin out the stove and we still bangin honest
Blowing on the O yo we call that ho an onion
Verse  Drake
Man where your ass was at when we took the city over
Where your ass was at when all theyd ask was whats the hold up
Where your ass was at when niggas first got the news
Now your ass around because we   re paying back dues
Where were you When all the dogs needed help
Lawyers and the commissary ain   t gon    pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom
Where your ass was at I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain   t got no choice
Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I   m selfmade selfish with my women selfemployed
I   ll buy the neighbors house if they complain about the noise
Man where your ass was at dog when niggas wouldn   t feed me
Where your ass was at dog when bitches didn   t need me
Where your ass was at last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at I had the  on my shoulders
Chorus Future
Where your ass was at dog when niggas wouldn   t feed me
Where your ass was at dog when bitches didn   t need me
Where your ass was at dog when niggas tried to run off
Where your ass was at dog You made me pull this gun out
Verse  Future
 for a walk through bitch don   t panic
Had them bitches fall through fucking like a savage
Heard you tryna swim in the ocean no jacket
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Heard that nigga came through squeezing on a ratchet
Serve a lot of dog food call you a mutt
Where your ass was at dog when I was on my comeup
The reason I   m here today cause I aint never gave up
Chorus Future
Where your ass was at dog when niggas wouldn   t feed me

Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Brace yourself Ill take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how Im slingin crack or move cocaine
This is culdesac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant but the stress that weighin on your brain
It was me L Boog and Yan Yan YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly wavin yo hand out the window     check yourself
Uh Warriors and Conans hope euphoria can slow dance
With society the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a lightskinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin that he did it
But ever since that day I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door fuck is up
Fuck you shootin for if you aint walkin up you fuckin punk
Pickin up the fuckin pump pickin off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin from AKs ARs Aye yall   duck
Thats what Momma said when we was eatin that free lunch
Aw man goddamn all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in  fuck yo truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Aint no peace treaty just piecin BGs up to preapprove
Bodies on top of bodies IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley make sure your colors correct
Make sure youre corporate or theyll be callin your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens that shit aint no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial I guess

Wake yo punkass up
It aint nothin but a Compton thang
Gyeah real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
Smoke somethin nigga
Hood Sup Cuz
It aint nothin but a Compton thang
Gyeah how we do
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin in the living room of my mommas pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin
In fact I got fired cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin at the mouth
I was straight tweakin the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick aka Comptons Human Sacrifice
Interlude MC Eiht
Gyeah cocaine weed
Niggas been mixin shit since the s loc
Sherm sticks buttnakeds

Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One times crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra Rosecrans Bullis its Compton
Verse  MC Eiht
Im still in the hood loc yeah thats cool
Shit the hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah thats like me I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drivebys in the hood lately shit
Couple of IVs with the fuckin spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew Im finna slay the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy hearts turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip yeah
Trip we in the hood still
So loc grab a strap cause yeah its so real yeah
Deal with the outcome a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grands where a mothafucka stand
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen would you believe me
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief
And its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage
Kill em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn they vandalizin the option
Of livin a lie drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin and drive
Hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen coward the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit a price on his head the tithes
Probably go to the projects I
Live inside the belly of the rough Compton USA
Made Me an Angel on Angel Dust what

All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane

Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin bullets reapin what you sow
And stackin up the footage livin on the go
And sleepin in a villa
Sippin from a Grammy and walkin in the buildin
Diamond in the ceilin marble on the floors
Beach inside the window peekin out the window
Baby in the pool godfather goals
Only Lord knows Ive been goin hammer
Dodgin paparazzi freakin through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters Brock wearin sandals
Yoga on a Monday stretchin to Nirvana
Watchin all the snakes curvin all the fakes
Phone never on I dont conversate
I dont compromise I just penetrate
Sex money murder   these are the breaks
These are the times level number 
Look up in the sky  is on the way
Sentence on the way killings on the way
Motherfucker I got winners on the way
You aint shit without a body on your belt
You aint shit without a ticket on your plate
You aint sick enough to pull it on yourself
You aint rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate gonna be our faith

Me and my niggas tryna get it ya bish
Hit the house lick tell me is you wit it ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know its vacant ya bish
Dreams of livin life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasnt cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond Let It Burn came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen ya bish
Park the car then we start rhymin ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You lookin like a easy comeup ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from ya bish
And thats a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue
Hook Kendrick Lamar
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you doin
Everybody gon respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
The one in front of the gun forever
And I been hustlin all day
Thisaway thataway
Through canals and alleyways just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And thats just how I feel nah nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
Thats just how I feel nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
Thats just how I feel nah nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
Thats just how I feel nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
Thats just how I feel
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Dreams of livin life like rappers do
Bump that new E after school
You know    Big Ballin With My Homies   
Earl Stevens had us thinkin rational
Back to reality we poor ya bish
Another casualty at war ya bish
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head
He said one day Ill be on tour ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But Ima purchase when that day is jerkin
Pull off at Churchs with Pirellis skirtin
Gang signs out the window ya bish
Hopin all of em offend you ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon crash it when nobodys home
Hook Kendrick Lamar
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison tell me what you doin
Everybody gon respect the shooter

Liquors spillin pistols poppin
Bakin soda YOLA whippin
Aint no turkey on Thanksgivin

I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day Im hustlin
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter nem
Get the fuck up out my way bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys dont see my stash
If they do tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass aint cut
Them serpents lurkin Blood
Bitches sellin pussy niggas sellin drugs
But its all good
Broken promises steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your Js and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin shaded under a money tree
Hook Kendrick Lamar

I am a sinner whos probably gonna sin again
Lord forgive me Lord forgive me
Things I dont understand
Sometimes I need to be alone

Verse 
Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me its painless
You dont know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes
I can feel the new people around me just want to be famous
You can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages to me thats amazin
To you thats a quick check
With all disrespect let me say this

Im tryin to keep it alive
And not compromise the feeling we love
Youre tryin to keep it deprived
And only cosign what radio does
And Im lookin right past you
We live in a world we live in a world on two different axles
You live in a world you livin behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital I know you had to
This shit is vital I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain tell me a watch and a chain
Is way more believable give me a feasible gain
Rather a seasonal name
Ill let the people know this is somethin you can blame
On yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
Ima break out and then hide every lock

Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin he was mobbin way belligerent and drunk
Talkin out his head philosophin on what the Lord had done
He said KDot can you pray for me
It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed show me how to overcome
He was lookin for some closure
Hopin I could bring him closer
To the spiritual my spirit do know better but I told him
I cant sugarcoat the answer for you this is how I feel
If somebody kill my son that mean somebody gettin killed
Tell me what you do for love loyalty and passion of
All the memories collected moments you could never touch
Ill wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
Ill catch a nigga leavin service if thats all I got
Ill chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like Bitch I did that
Aint no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I cant even keep the peace dont you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister touch my woman
Touch my daddy touch my niece
Touch my nephew touch my brother
You should chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap

Hail Mary Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us
Its murder on my street your street back streets
Wall Street corporate offices
Banks employees and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts Donald Trumps in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin
Pass the gin I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in you Crippin or you married to Blood
Ill ask again     oops accident
Its nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists et cetera et cetera
Americas reflections of me thats what a mirror does

Its not a place
This country is to me a sound

Im talkin about dark room perfume go go
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up you aint never gotta say shit

You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
Youre in the mood for empathy theres blood in my pen
Better yet where your friends and em
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And yall curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party she wanna go and party
Nigga dont approach her with that Atari
Nigga that aint good game homie sorry

I really hope you play this cause ol girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these oneoff vacations youve been takin
Clearly a lot for me to take in it dont make sense
Young East African girl you too busy fuckin with your other man
I was tryna put you on game put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it maybe one day
When you figure out youre gonna need someone
When you figure out its alright here in the city
And you dont run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice poetic justice
You were so new to this life but goddamn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress ooh
Good God what you doin that walk for

I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more

But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write em down for real PS

Makin sure my punctuation curve every letter heres true
Livin my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
Im talkin poetic justice poetic justice

Would you trust it I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb its you lookin in the mirror
Love is not just a verb its you lookin for it maybe
Call me crazy we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin sex drive when you swerve

There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Verse 
I never knew a luh luhluh a love like this
Gotta be somethin for me to write this
Queen I aint seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit lets spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I aint gon assault them    cause I probably did it too
Because of you feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light
But they cant handle the glare
You know I aint the type to walk around with matchin shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest
And hurt you the most
They say the end is near its important that we close
To the most high
Regardless of what happen on Him lets rely
Hook
There are times
When youll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines

Verse 
Its important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
Theres so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But thats fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi nights moon you my light
If Heaven had a height you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop through you I see that all
Lets stick to understandin and we wont fall
For better or worse times I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family love aint simple
Why cant it be anything worth havin you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It dont take a whole day to recognize sunshine

When youll need someone
I will be by your side

Its kind of fresh you listen to more than hiphop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when its time to
Thinkin you fresh suggestin beats I should rhyme to
At times when Im lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when its time to
My hearts dictionary defines you its love and happiness
Truthfully its hard tryin to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex aint gon keep you
But as my equal its how I must treat you
As my reflection in light Ima lead you
And whatevers right Ima feed you
Diggada diggada diggada diggadiggadada
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you peace

Verse 
I met this girl when I was  years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money those studs was miccheckin her
But I respected her she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her turn on the air for her
And just cool out cool out and listen to her
Sittin on a bone wishin that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be then it would be
   Cause we related physically and mentally
And she was fun then Id be geeked when shed come around
Slim was fresh joe when she was underground
Original pure untampered a down sister
Boy I tell you I miss her

Verse 
Now periodically I would see
Ol girl at the clubs and at the house parties
She didnt have a body but she started gettin thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin the violence
About my people she was teachin me
By not preachin to me but speakin to me
In a method that was leisurely so easily I approach
She dug my rap thats how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast and that was cool
Cause around the same time I went away to school
And Im a man of expandin so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in LA
And she did stud she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the problack was goin out of style
She said Afrocentricity was of the past
So she got into R&B hiphouse bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and its all good
I wasnt salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her she was becomin wellrounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin fun not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung
Chorus
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
To the beat yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
Aone two yall and you dont stop
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop
And to the beat Com gotta be the sure shot
Ayes yes yall and you dont stop

Verse 
I mightve failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials shes universal
She used to only swing it with the innercity circle
Now she be in the burbs lookin rock and dressin hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin bout poppin Glocks servin rocks and hittin switches
Now shes a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches
Always smokin blunts and gettin drunk
Tellin me sad stories now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest before she got into showbiz
I did her not just to say that I did it
But Im committed girl hes committed but so many niggas hit it
That shes just not the same lettin all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin her and takin her to the sewer
But Ima take her back hopin that the shit stop
   Cause who Im talkin about yall is hiphop
Chorus
To the beat yall and you dont stop

One day when the war is won
We will be sure we will be sure
Oh glory
Glory glory Ohh Glory glory
Verse  Common
Hands to the Heavens no man no weapon
Formed against yes glory is destined
Every day women and men become legends
Sins that go against our skin become blessings
The movement is a rhythm to us
Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin us
Justice for all just aint specific enough
One son died his spirit is revisitin us
True and livin livin in us resistance is us
Thats why Rosa sat on the bus
Thats why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up
When it go down we woman and man up
They say Stay down and we stand up
Shots we on the ground the camera panned up
King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up

Verse  Common
Selma is now for every man woman and child
Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
They marched with the torch we gon run with it now
Never look back we done gone hundreds of miles
From dark roads he rose to become a hero
Facin the league of justice his power was the people
Enemy is lethal a king became regal
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle
The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
We sing our music is the cuts that we bleed through
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history
No one can win the war individually
It takes the wisdom of the elders and young peoples energy
Welcome to the story we call victory
The comin of the Lord my eyes have seen the glory
Chorus
One day when the glory comes
It will be ours it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure we will be sure
Oh glory
Glory glory
Oh glory glory
Oh glory

Yeah glory glory

When the war is won when its all said and done
Well cry glory oh glory glory glory

My motto is Chicago bitch
Everybody know you sweet what the problem is
Don   t play dumb I   m the one that acknowledged it
Son of a bitch I imagine what your father is
She said    How you make your opponent
The rapper of the moment    His style he don   t own it
Acting all hard when he hardly like that
You gon    mess around and make me catch a body like that
Awwww don   t do it
Cause every song you make Joe is really ho music
I heard you said you wasn   t a bitch because you sing
You a bitch because you cling like a bitch that   s eighteen
Can   t say my name but rap about a nigga   s wife
You so black and white trying to live a nigga   s life
I   m taking too long with this amateur guy
You ain   t wet nobody nigga you Canada dry

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Its a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me
Verse 
Yeah you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldnt sleep cause on the real he had five kids
Live nigs real niggas express and taste it
At crap games black dames and big faces
Cases in court fam showing love and support
You and your babys mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
Thats why we dont know how til were older men
If love is a place Ima go again
At least now now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then youre home again
Ive seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he dont want to end
Yo
Hook
Verse 
Its all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love hoping itd become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Trying to find herself again much of that shed have gave
Love can free us to it some of us react as a slave
Funny we love em more when theyre relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw is he actin afraid
Everybody loves sun why do I attract shade
Heard of the love of money but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so shed understand
What it is to be loved by a man
Hook
Verse 
Some say that Im a dreamer cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in fall in it
With the right companion we all in it

Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people love always

Say it then I do it I never missed em
Fuck em after I kissed em sit back and listen

Did I mention my circles smaller than an intervention
Then some beautiful women tell me Im handsome
Then I snatch they heart and make the pussy the ransom
I fuck em until inside they belly burst
Stop it drop the beat and then we cue the verse
Spitting lyrics like how a Mac really disperse
Slaughter MCs and resurrect them when they in the hearse
They say I got too many styles bitch Ive been diverse
They scared to jump in the cypher I be all up in it first
My apologies but if youre after me then it gets worse

Son of the most so from up high I shine
Suited in Prada stay mellow like lala
Young fresh with dollars ladies go gaga

Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash
Given what I ask pure religion and cash

Told him for health care my music is the medicine

Verse  Kanye West
Break records at Louis ate breakfast at Gucci
My girl a superstar all from a home movie
Bow on our arrival the unAmerican idols
What niggas did in Paris got em hangin off the Eiffel
Yeah Im talkin business we talkin CIA
Im talkin George Tenet I seen him the other day
He asked me about my Maybach think he had the same
Except mine tinted and his might have been rented
You know white people get money dont spend it
Or maybe they get money buy a business
I rather buy  gold chains and go ignant
I know Spike Lee gon kill me but let me finish
Blame it on the pigment we livin no limits
Them gold Master P ceilings was just a figment
Of our imagination MTV cribs
Now Im lookin at a crib right next to where TC lives
Thats Tom Cruise whatever she accuse
He wasnt really drunk he just had a frew brews
Pass the refreshments a cool cool beverage
Everything I do need a news crews presence
Speedboat swerve homie watch out for the waves
Im way too black to burn from sunrays
So I just meditate at the home in Pompeii
About how I could build a new Rome in one day
Every time Im in Vegas they screamin like hes Elvis
But I just wanna design hotels and nail it
Shit is real got me feelin Israelian
Like Bar Refaeli or Gisele   no thats Brazilian
Went through deep depression when my mama passed
Suicide what kinda talk is that
But I been talkin to God for so long
That if you look at my life I guess hes talkin back
Fuckin with my clique

Im letting you down every day

Why do I keep on running away
Verse  JAYZ
Look I apologize often womanize
Took for my child to be born see through a womans eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song I dont deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
Please come back to Rome you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
   Please pick up the phone pick up the phone   
I said    Dont embarrass me    instead of    Be mine   
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your st birthday
You matured faster than me I wasnt ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for all the stillborns cause I wasnt present
Your body wouldnt accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say Im all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin of all the time you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize
Chorus Hannah Williams
Im never gonna treat you
Im never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh
Verse  JAYZ
I apologize our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay til our backs burn
Were supposed to laugh til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didnt know
I promised I cried I couldnt hold
I suck at love I think I need a doover
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over what if you over my shit
Chorus Hannah Williams
Im never gonna treat you
Im never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh
Verse  JAYZ
And if my children knew
I dont even know what I would do
If they aint look at me the same
I would probly die with all the shame
You did what with who
What good is a m  nage    trois when you have a soulmate
You risked that for Blue
If I wasnt a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blues tooth the tooth fairy didnt pay

Im fresh up out my coma
I got my Momma and my Daddy and my homies in my corner
Its gonna take a miracle they say
For me to walk again and talk again but anyway
I get fronted some keys to get back on my feet
And everything that nigga said came to reality
Living like a baller loc
Having money and blowing hella chronic smoke
I bought my Momma a Benz and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now Im rolling in a ninetrizzay El DoRag
Just remember who changed your mind
Cause when you start settripping that ass is mine
Indeed agreed proceed to smoke weed

Cuz my eyes wanna journey some mo really doe check it out

Shackled from head to toe

Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard thats where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks just in case the war pops off
Cause you cant tell whats next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably wont make it to see twentytwo
I put that on my Momma Ima ride for you Baby Boo

Lodi Dodi we likes to party
We dont cause trouble we dont bother nobody
Were just some niggas whore on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic right
For all my doggs keepin yall in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Cause its cool when you cause the cozy conditioning
Which we create cause thats our mission
So listen close to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around  oclock in the morning
I gave myself a strech up a morning yawn and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said Um mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top dog of them all
There was a ruffle duffle five minutes it lasted
The mirror said You are you conceited bastard
Well thats true Thats why we never have no beef
So I slipped on my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file for my fingernails
Im true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnsons Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now Im fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks with my allblue Chucks
Stepped out the house stopped short oh no
I went back in I forgot my Indo
Then I dilly dally I ran through an alley
I bumped into this smoker named Sally from the Valley
This was a girl playing hardtoget
So I said Whats wrong cause she looked upset
She said um
Nancy Flethcer
Its all because of you Im feeling sad and blue
You went away now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so how much youll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me
Verse 
Damn now what was I to do
Shes crying over me and she was feelin blue
I said Um dont cry dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys
Her mean mother steps then says to me Hi
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said What was goin on
I tried to break it up I said Stop it just leave her
She said If I cant smoke none she cant either
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um they gave chase they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbin my dick
And saying
Why dont you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
Ill give you all my love today
Doggy Doggy Doggy cant you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg your love is here to stay
And on and on and on she kept going
The bitch been around before my mother born
I said Cheer up and I gave her a hit
I said You cant have me Im too young for you bitch
She said No youre not then she starts cryin
I says Im  she says Stop lyin
I says I am go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy I cant be your lover

I used to care what people thought but now I care more

We in here like Rogaine or leave it like Cobain
And when Im long gone whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs got a Lambo like LeBrons mom
And no matter where all of my friends go Emily Fam and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk at least I think so cant tell
Cause when them checks clear theyre not here
Cause they dont care its kinda sad but Im laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping Im glad that it happened I mean it
Between us I think theres something special and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand even if you dont understand hold up

You start calling you start crying

I cant find you the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isnt half bad

Please think before you come for the great one
Please whos a real nigga and who aint one
Please somebody stop me

They gon ask if I can play this shit back to back
I took a break from Views now its back to that nigga Six

Verse  Big Sean
Ho shut the fuck up
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what Ive been through
Im finna do what I didnt do
And still waking up like the rents due
Not complicated its simple
I got sexy ladies a whole Benzfull
And to them hoes Im everything   everything but gentle
But I still take my time man I guess Im just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit thats old fashion
Nigga see what Im saying no closed caption
I paint pics see the shit good sex need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth drink a fifth load the nine
Leave you split in the half smoke a half need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got  problems but a bitch aint one
I got  problems getting rich aint one
Like I got trust issues
Im sorry for the people Ive pushed out
Im the type to have a bulletproof condom
And still gotta pull out
But thats just me and I aint perfect
I aint a saint but I am worth it
If its one thing I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it aint working
Lil bitch

Verse 
The other night
Lavish Lee told me that Im all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasnt you you would be dissin you dawg
Damn okay from that perspective
I see what youre talkin bout no way to soften that
Cause me I was tryna find out where I lost em at
But maybe I aint lose em at all
Maybe I keep movin forward and theyre just stagnant
They aint movin at all
But when they need a favor who do they call
Maybe Im searchin for the problems
Askin what was said and who was involved
Too focused on peoples feedback and provin em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit no matter whose foot its on
These days feel like Im squeezin in em
Whoever wore em before just wasnt thinkin big enough
Im bout to leave em with em
Cause if I run in the game in these man the seams are splittin
No pun intended but theyre smellin defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it who meetin me there
They tell him that hes talkin crazy but he doesnt care
Bein humble dont work as well as bein aware
Listen up boy youre better off eavesdroppin
We already got spring  poppin
PND droppin Repsup P droppin
Majid Jordan droppin OB droppin not to mention me droppin
Feel like we paid the refs off man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah been on the move like the lease is up
And I cant even name one person thats keepin up
Damn fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself how do we match up now
Cause Im only  and Im only gettin better
If I havent passed you yet watch me catch up now for real

Your simple voodoo is so maniacal were liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She dont love me she make money she dont study that
She gon give it to me aint gon tell me run it back
She gon take the brain to wetter plains she spit on that
The doors have signs with dont try to rhyme with
VH has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary Id probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin commas

Verse  Phife Dawg
You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians
Fuck yall know about true competition
Thats like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin
The only one whos hitting are the ones thats currently spittin
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world thats equal for women with no division
Boy I tell you thats vision
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten
The Tribe be the best in they division
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
Who can come back years later still hit the shot
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block

This is how I represent over this here beat

Sleep if you want NyQuil will help you get your Zs troop

Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
Im vexed fuming Ive had it up to here

The hiphop sound is well agitated
Wont ever waste no time on a played out ego

Unh Unh Unh All over the track man
Unh pardon me unh As I come back
As I did it yo I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron

Change your little drawers cause your pants were saggin
Try to step to this I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Chickity Choco the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel buttcheeks they were kicking

We used to kick routines and presence was fittin

Heh okay you on point Phife All the time Tip

Well then grab the microphone and let your words rip
Verse  Phife Dawg
Now heres a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother tell your father send a telegram
Im like an energizer cause you see I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack thats where youre dead wrong
I slayed that buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
Youd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MCs
Cause I love it when you wack MCs despise me
They get vexed I roll next cant none contest me
Im just a fly MC whos five foot three and very brave
On top remaining no home training cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see my auras positive I dont promote no junk
See Im far from a bully and I aint a punk
Extremity in rhythm yeah thats what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word

Ayo Tip do you recall when we used to rock What
Those fly routines on your cousins block
Um let me see damn I cant remember
I receive the message and you will play the sender
You on point Tip All the time Phife

So play the resurrector and give the dead some life
Verse  QTip
Okay if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed Im agile plus Im worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect Umm
Well its kind of simple just remain your own
Or youll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number fourthousandandeighty
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back cause I think they smoke crack
I dont doubt it look at how they act
Well off to better things like a hiphop forum
Pass me the rock and Ill score em with decorum
And proper   what you say Hammer Proper
Rap is not pop if you call it that then stop

Verse  Phife Dawg
Yo microphone check one two what is this
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause Ill always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still dont know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your {ass}
I never half step cause Im not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name aint Special Ed
So wont you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking its all about me
Even though deep in my heart it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black youre buggin out
Verse  QTip
Zulu Nation brothers last creation
Minds get flooded ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across so bust the floss
As I go in between the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work umm
As I crack the monotone
Children of the jazz so get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they cant do rap
For its Abstract original
You cant get your own and thats pitiful
I know Id be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B but I cant and thats bugged

Verse  Phife Dawg
Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding always surrounding
Pulsing just like a migraine pounding
You dont really fret you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling of absolute tense
You soar off to another world deep in your mind
But people seem to take that as being unkind
Oh yo hes acting stank really on a regal
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nikes
If a crowd is in my realm Im saying  mic please
Hiphop is living cant yank the plug
If you do the result will end up kind of bugged
Verse  QTip
Yo I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road see I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
Im the type of brother with the crazy extended hand kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause youre feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
Its your brain against my mind for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out
Hook

Verse  QTip
Can I kick it To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this did you really know what live was
Comprehend to the track for its why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun thats what I love
A lower plateau is what were above
If you diss us we wont even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives its a plus love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove
Can I kick it

Handle rocks with the capital G ball on the beat

If rationale is naturale or a weave

Settin press we on a permanent steeze
Im in a world where my princess is Leia
And shes feeling my Vader
And my lure grows greater and greater

Verse  Butterfly
We like the breeze flow straight out of our lids
Then they got moved by these hardrock Brooklyn kids
Us floor rush when the DJs booming classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hiphop records
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthoughtof dimensions
Whys it so fly cause hiphop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light bluesuede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin chunky rhythms right down ya block
We be to rap what key be to lock
But

Verse  Butterfly
Boogie jive and rap is life where Im from
Where Im from Ahmed play with Izzy where Im from
Where Im from it be like run your coat black
Jupiter keeps her fat beats by the pack
Where Im from nappy hair is life
We be reading Marx where Im from
The kids be rocking Clarks where Im from
You turn around your cap you talk over a beat
And dig some sounds booming out a jeep
Where Im from cocoons hide the youth swoon units hundred proof
You want some beef they will cut you some where Im from
The beats is infinite where Im from
Voodoo ashubani gangsta lean where Im from
Im interplanetary my insect movements vary
Its kinky if its hair G where Im from
The fire hoses blow
Its purple when it snow
I do a hit and go split
Its hip whats hip
When hip is just the norm
Cause Planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all its forms
The kinks the dance the prints in all the shirts
My grandmother told my Mama that its Africa at work
On vibes we freak them universal beats
You find it at the spot you hit at ends of every week
We twist exist to spin the maddest hits
Up here funk is our neighbour so we paid her a visit
The lip we sip cant house the nine zips
For rock we cant do nothing for this we come equipped
Off disc off tape rap blasting til from eight
The really truly fat the fly on the flip
Cocoa gotta know how Planets gotta roll
Speak the mega cool get funky as a goal
Its calm relax were only some new jacks
That acts from the funk but dont play the role
Where you from
Verse  Doodlebug
Weekend Dig Plans got Ts where Im from
Where Im from its Clarence  where Im from
Where Im from brothers took the beats and got fly
Why Thats most asked by  where Im from
Faking the funk you get did
Projects tenements pyramids where Im from
We living off the boom boom crack
Its that hiphop rockers jazz when I max
Peace be the greeting of the insect tribe
Pestilent forces cant catch the vibe
We live to love and we love to rock mics
We speak in ghetto tongue cause ghettos the life
Food for thought so get a buffet plate
The lyrics are so fat you might gain weight
So just watch me step alone into the sunset
Left foot right foot  mic check
Brewing funk inside my soul kitchen
So pull up a chair heres a bib have a listen
Of hardhead intervene damn I know youre fluent
Yeah cause Doodle aint having it and Butterfly knew it
Where you from
Verse  Ladybug
Venus acts a fool at the square right yeah
Doctors engineer in a pair right yeah
Hiphop made a point last year right yeah
But Planets is the joint this year right yeah
Planets got the dubs and live to grasshop
Duck out from the fuzz that sweat the hiphop
Rising like we foam get it from the dome
Im from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
We can get a kit without no thread
Feeling funky beats go straight to the head
Fall into a club dig on what we love
It be past six before we reach bed
Butter freaks on relics we say those are fat
Doodle Mecc and Silk the quad where its at
We need to stack a sack for rap to take us dap
So we treat our clips just like busting caps
Rip it till dawn kick it till dawn
HipHop is the fix or else we be gone
People thought they canned it
Rap is not by bandits
Digable Planets got it going on

I was raised in the ways of the Manchu Clan
And five elements posture take a Bboy stance
With the gold front shining baggy pants sagging
This Brooklyn styling got the fly girls smiling
But Im climbing finding new ways of rhyming
Not living like a star its strictly bout surviving
Diving deep into the grooves of the ghetto
This downtown flavor shines from many angles
Yes the notorious with rhymes so glorious
The Manchu Monkey over flunkies is victorious
Rappers be boring us with rhymes so conventional
Dazed and amazed when they hear the three dimensional
Lyrical skills of the insect in motion
Coasting down Fulton with a bag of magic potion
Now Im rolling with the seven and the crescents
Puffing some expression
Manifesting todays lessons
Stressing the fact that Im solar guaranteed to go far
Cause the mind is interstellar
Still peace like that so have no fear
But Im slicker this year
Im slicker this year

Verse  Ishmael Butler
Butterfly searching for a relax
Pulling from the jazz stacks cause its Sunday
On the air is incense sounds to the ceiling
Tried to get this feeling since Monday
Looking out the window watching all the people go
Bugging off a funny vibe cause now it seems theyre equal
Wonder what would Trane say wonder what my pop say
Bugging off the calmness in the Apple
Who me Im cooling in New York
Im chilling in New York
The hoods is on my block and the brothers at the court
The baseball hats is on and the projects is calm
Dreamtimes extended and highly recommended
But early birds like mes up checking out the scene
The early worms jog forget about your job
Just come dig the essence while the decadence is hidden
When people act like people the theory is in pigeon
If you know the norm its like Hades transformed
On Sundays early hours the city sprouts its flowers
So get with the rhythms while you getting with the Planets
Vibe off the jams but dont take em for granted just chill
Refrain
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
Verse  Mary Ann Vieira and Craig Irving
We venture through the streets in search of funky beats
Extensive is the travels and its heavy on the sneaks
Ye its kicking out the speakers of the Sunday morning jeepers
My man do Planets do it lovely
Am I my brothers keeper
We foot it to the park where the swoon units walk
And sit with the phoenicians digging on musicians
Hanging with the rebels sipping on a Snapple
Bugging with my crew just tripping in the Apple
You be thinking peace when youre vibing with your flock
But you be thinking damn everybody got a Glock
If you got some beef please express that in silence
Or else violence
But right here is the life its the children of the concrete
Living off the fruits and the functions of the fat beats
Hiphops all around the members is growing
Please dig on the sounds cause the good vibes they snowing so chill
Refrain
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot

Verse  Ishmael Butler
Wake up praying that the games on
Maybe its the Running Rebs maybe its the Knicks
Maybe its a rerun of an old TV show
Like Hawaii  or karate flicks
Maybe if the phone rings Butterfly will take wings
Speaking on some cool things fronting like I cope
Born unto flat ground now Im chilling shaky ground
Reaching for Pacific Heights Sunday is my rope dig it
Sundays to relax
Sundays to relax
Some Sunday morning drama is calling up my Mama
The hot line is in I guess the silvers knew the deal
Vibing off the jams of the crews on Sugarhill
Lay around and think aint nothing to do
Checking out some Fromm some Sartre Camus
Mingus Ah Um damn Roach can drum
The DPs are life there they go here they come
Its time to grab some loot put on the Timber boots
Checking out some Dalis like Tasha and Kamali
New York is a museum with its posters and graffiti
If youre in the city on Sunday
Come check me get with me

It was  on a beautiful th day of July
There was not a cloud to speak of so the orange sun hung
Lonely in the sky
I lay prone in my catbeat home
Listening to fine nappy Jackie and his jazzcats horn
Sliding in a tape of Bird on Verve when suddenly rang my phone
Hey Butterfly the voice said
Slip on some duds comb out your fro and slide on down to my pad
The vibe here is very pleasant and I truly request your presence
A problem of great magnitude has arose
And as we speak it grows
Damn what could it be I thought
A juice I bought and rolled on down to her spot
Seeing bros I know slapping fives I arrived and pressed G
And there was Nikki
Lookin some kind of sad with tears fallin from her eyes
She sat me down and dug my frown and began to run it down
You remember my boyfriend Sid that fly kid who I love
Well our love was often a verb and spontaneity has brought a third
But due to our youth and economic state we wish to terminate
About this we dont feel great but baby thats how it is
But the feds have dissed me
They ignored and dismissed me
The prolifers harass me outside the clinic
And call me a murderer now thats hate
So needless to say were in a mental state of debate
Hey beautiful bird I said digging her somber mood
The fascists are some heavy dudes
They dont really give a damn about life
They just dont want a woman to control her body
Or have the right to choose
But baby that aint nothin
They just want a male finger on the button
Because if you say war they will send them to die by the score
Aborting mission should be your volition
But if Souter and Thomas have their way
Youll be standing in line unable to get Welfare while theyll be out
Hunting and fishing
It has always been around it will always have a niche
But theyll make it a privilege not a right
Accessible only to the rich
Hey Prolifers need to dig themselves
Because life doesnt stop after birth
And for a child born to the unprepared
It might even just get worse
The situation would surely change if they were to find themselves in it
Supporters of the HBomb and firebombing clinics
What type of shit is that Orwellian in fact
If Roe v Wade was overturned would not the desire remain intact
Leaving young girls to risk their healths
And doctors to botch and watch as they kill themselves
I dont want to sound macabre
But hey isnt it my job
To lay it on the masses and get them off their asses
To fight against these fascists
So whatever you decide make that move with pride
Sid will be there and so will I
An insect til I die
Rhythms and sounds
Spinning around
Confrontations
Across the nation
Your block
My block
Dreadlocks
What a shock
Land of the free
But not me not me
Cop
Alright boy

Ah man

Clouds of purple haze keep me in a daze
The jazz the jive the poetry
The style the lingo the bags of equality
Many different things try to get to me
But in a world of hard rock I keep my humility
The funkanaut from the kingdom of not
With galactic sure shot they cant wont dont stop
Flock to the rhythm I bring
Sing songs call survival on the Mingus revival
Scored the bass hit with my bugged out clique
Its Doodlebug give me love for a visual script
Sip the groove juice its kind of rough
Sevens never bluff I had enough eleven
Chorus
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Verse  Butterfly
In the east I rose
Froze in the pose
Of a land diseased
Flows that cooler summer breeze
Nikki did Kevins braids we got four in the Lac
As we swoop at warp seven holler dont crowd cats
Cause look corpie is the color and Butter he do it low
All you hear is poppers and rubber Im saying oh
Man we keep it popping on hot days
Shit I got the fish eggs dropping any block you dip
And I dazzle that mood with the cool out fool
Easing semiswerve to the curb like the do
Im fro blow got that right
Groove with soul and Im still spinnin
Cross  and indicate them something else
Blackest space deepest sea
Scoff My shits a natural high the man cant put no thing on me
Now catch me when my mind stretch out its astro black
Time reaching into end nappy afro blue
We Swing fightin out the corners
Do my thaaang like Huey with it nigga
Chorus
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Butterfly
The ticky ticky buzz the sun wakes the sky
I fumble through my fuzz and buzz Mr I
Tell him scoop the beats in the flying saucer kit
Meet me at the port with the nickel bags and shit
Tell my pops Im out earthbound with the crew
He said Butterfly may the boogie be with you
Left my moms a note with these quotes on a trunk
It says I split to Earth to resurrect the funk
A dozen Snapple pops and a little box of beats
Travelin through space with the funky funky beats
Stopped at Pluto to cop some petrol
Met some Klingons and got our things on
Cruisin warp  with Mr Wiggles in the mix
Hendrix passin peas star child get the fix
The saucer shook the heavens with the blooms and the blams
Because when we hit New York  shazam
We droppin like a comet and this Vulcan tried to Spock it
These martians tried to do it but knew they couldnt cop it
The others from our brother planet lands in the flesh
From up in sector  yes yall
Doodlebug
And its good to be here
When we landed up on lex
Stirrin up the ground with the sound of Doug E Fresh
And the hard rockin kids that did it for the black
With the Pumas on their feet and the bombers on their back
We learned it and we earned it so you know you got to hand it
We planned it when we left how to freak it and to slam it
Add a Ladybug transformation is complete
For the metamorphosis from the box to the Jeep
Ladybug
And its good to be here
Gettin fly with the raps
We love it where we from but we kick it where we at
Bumpin out with somethin that pops and transcends
Dps baby its slim but not thin
In amongst the pebbles we rocks on your blocks
Soakin in the ghetto for kids that have not
Slappin on some skin when we slam check the cheers
So we greet their virgin ears with a kiss
Its so good to be here
All
We jazz up the streets to prove we have beats
Fat jazz fat style and the sound so sweet
And there aint no doubt that you got to check
Doodle Silk Butter Mecc
Its so good to be here
Butterfly
Yeah baby thats the style
The jazz can fill a club or papers by the pile
Just ask toy soldier toy soldier could of told you
At the boomin funk hut it was the Afro with the butt
So to the flam lovers that crowd in dark spots
So see em kick the lingo and grip that little crotch
Now we have arrived with crazy boogie sounds
Get yourself a mate todays to boogie down
This is all we know we feel it when we slams
You could hear the love it comes out in our jams
The hiphop diggin cats just deliverin the words
From the ghettodwellin youth to the bourgies in the burbs
And its good to be here
Butterfly
DPS forever hit ya with the live stuff
Suliman the Bronx Ripper on the live puff

The noise that we made is blue in color sound
Toys who played my crew couldnt walk the new ground
Or chalk the new sound
A bop like Teddy Charles was burning
When I excurse on excursions
Arriving at the doors of mind shores of seas
Burnt you with degrees solarly
Plus my leather jacket go acid disappear in the wisp
In the mist with a fist
Proletariat Cadilac steering it
Fro soul gold Panther crew grab our poppers
Now Im making bacon
Still saying wa ah salaam ah lakum
Fresh joints we make em like water
Butter rap treasures at my leisure whatever whatever
So I gave my mind a pound cause yall we had it down
We symbolize the blessed and represent the rest
Grabs in my pockets I release my hot rockets
KB said What you give em I was like Mad rhythm
Thats my junk

Whered they find the stuff to freak it like a wizard
Slick just like a lizard
Really weird or is it
Its just the logic from how we rocks it
Pop shock picks it up and drops its
We the synthesis of then and now melts
Channeled to the masses through a DJ and some felts
Long haired hippies Afro blacks
All get together across the tracks
Because when we shows up rhythm rolls up
Funk cannot be measured while the pleasure grows up
Life aint what it seems life is but a dream
Planets wreaking havoc is as constant as the rain
Yeah
Sample
The song is by some groovy cats
If you can dig

I just opened up the pack in an hour Ill ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling fuck me

Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy Tommy and Chuckie

Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me I know you still remember me

Everywhere that I go everywhere they be asking hows it going
Say the goings well go figure Victors light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell all praise to the God
God knows hes a pro hes a pro like COINTEL
Check check mate check me take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldnt kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days they get so high
Burn trees smoke chlorophyll til they cant feel shit
Shitfaced faced it  hits on this L
Elevated train and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill miseducated my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad enough of that jazz
Asshole absinthe up in that glass

Rip brain dead take a tug and then pass

Verse  Twista
I could make a flow pitter patter with a patter pitter  juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
Thats the new principle sometimes Imma be about some hoes
Sometimes Imma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast Im the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
Cause Im addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me Im the ObiWan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like Im offa codeine low key
Dont be so judgmental even though Im reminiscing
If I dont know what I miss is
Ima end up figuring out that its home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and Im thanking
I need em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug and I cant cause Im stanking
Never too old for a spanking IGH

Probably scared of all the refugees look like we had a fuckin hurricane here
Theyll be shooting whether its dark or not I mean the days is pretty dark a lot

And then everybody wanna dip
Told you I aint worried I aint scared of the booth
All you can do is spit a verse of the truth
Merge the mixture with the purest and the fruits
And the thirst just the worst its the curse of the juice

They booked the nicest hotels on the th floor
With the big wide windows with the suicide doors
Aint no blood on my money aint no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isnt close aint no visitin Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
Im at war with my wrongs Im writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited Im a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
Im feeling shortness of breath so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water ugh

I got my city doing front flips
When every father mayor rapper jump ship
I guess thats why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets so my daughter can have somewhere to play
Im the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I aint goin to hell or to Hillman
Igh Igh Igh Igh for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Cant stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous you dont know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man I dont even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Dosido
Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

Verse
Kicked off my shoes tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatchless necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah I inhaled who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young just turned older than him
I seen it happen I seen it happen I see it always
He still be screaming I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And Im hungry Im just not that thirsty
As of late all my verses seem not so versey
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back like Thats not your jersey
Stressin pullin my hair out hoping I dont get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I dont get sick
Making all of this money hoping I dont get rich
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth dont rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls is that appealing to you
From your cubicle desktop what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Couldve threw him an alleyoop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vics still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that antiviolence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And Im only getting greedier
And Im still Mr Youmedia
And I still cant find Talent
And Im still choosing classmates that wouldnt fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks Im good enough
And Mama Jan still dont take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

I used to talk way too much you used to know everything
You couldnt stand me I couldnt stand you
You said Im steady playin but you steady playin too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place
But in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me too worried bout Frooties and Chews
Til I found out all the shawdys with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

Then kicking all out like Mr Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain

What the fuck is caution
Often I leave em flossing in KAWS exes next to coffins
Lost in translation the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
Thats great Im home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees huh
Im getting blazed thinking bout those days
I had the top off the GT like toupees
One finger in the air alls fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you dont even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham rock LA to Harlem
If you say Get em Mike G then I got em
One man squadron nigga Im a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or its gonna be real

Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now Im all grown same song just a different waltz
Fire what I talk but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit your mistress on my hit list
And Im lifted til Im stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin area

Course you know the vibes just as fly as the rhymes
On the song cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars

Swallowin sarapin and settin fire to sheriffs whips
Whoops whoops Fuckin AllAmerican terrorist
Crushin rapper larynx to feed em a fuckin carrot stick
And me I just spent a year Ferrisin
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow tight line might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit grimey get dinero type
Feral fuckin illapparelwearin pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin fridges tippin over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixtyday chips from fuckin awesome anonymous
Call him bloated til he show em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin hot as dunkin scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada drivin drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova Im rollin over the novices
And roamin through the forest and spittin cold as his porridge is
Stay gold til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again lord of lips
Bored of this forklift the tippy top best under  list
Stormin the gate ensurin the bass
Scorchin leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me we savages half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who dont give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact your swagger is tacky
So see me you cant like Crunchy Black catchin a taxi
Uh back like lateral passin
With that motherfuckin gladiator manner of rappin
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi please
Verse  Tyler the Creator
OF shit thats all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin down Fax Wolf Gang run the fuckin block
Storefront knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape and my shoes
Um I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later for our label yeah we own it
I started an empire I aint even old enough
To drink a fucking beer Im tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggas in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the nword
And the ones that got called weird fag bitch nerd
Cause you was into jazz kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we aint actin right
Always try to turn our fuckin color into black and white
But theyll never change em never understand em
Radicals my anthem turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin bein mad as fuck
Just admit not only are we talented were rad as fuck bitches

Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom
Where your ass was at I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain   t got no choice
Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy

Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Brace yourself Ill take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how Im slingin crack or move cocaine
This is culdesac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant but the stress that weighin on your brain
It was me L Boog and Yan Yan YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly wavin yo hand out the window     check yourself
Uh Warriors and Conans hope euphoria can slow dance
With society the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a lightskinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin that he did it
But ever since that day I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door fuck is up
Fuck you shootin for if you aint walkin up you fuckin punk
Pickin up the fuckin pump pickin off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin from AKs ARs Aye yall   duck
Thats what Momma said when we was eatin that free lunch
Aw man goddamn all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in  fuck yo truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Aint no peace treaty just piecin BGs up to preapprove
Bodies on top of bodies IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley make sure your colors correct
Make sure youre corporate or theyll be callin your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens that shit aint no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial I guess

Let me teach you some lessons about the street
Smoke somethin nigga
Hood Sup Cuz
It aint nothin but a Compton thang
Gyeah how we do
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin in the living room of my mommas pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin
In fact I got fired cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin at the mouth
I was straight tweakin the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick aka Comptons Human Sacrifice
Interlude MC Eiht

Verse  MC Eiht
Im still in the hood loc yeah thats cool
Shit the hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah thats like me I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drivebys in the hood lately shit
Couple of IVs with the fuckin spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew Im finna slay the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy hearts turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip yeah

So loc grab a strap cause yeah its so real yeah
Deal with the outcome a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grands where a mothafucka stand
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen would you believe me
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief
And its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage
Kill em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn they vandalizin the option
Of livin a lie drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin and drive
Hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen coward the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit a price on his head the tithes
Probably go to the projects I
Live inside the belly of the rough Compton USA
Made Me an Angel on Angel Dust what
*Scratches*
MAAd city
Compton

Verse 
Now I done grew up round some people livin their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels
Some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular that was my problem
I was in a dark room loud tunes
Lookin to make a vow soon
That Ima get fucked up fillin up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip then somebody said to me

All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar
If it do then youre like me
Makin excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me

Dont you feel bad I probably sleep
And never ever wake up
Never ever wake up never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough

Born inside the beast my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was  on cell motel we didnt have nowhere to stay
At  I   ve done so well hit cartwheel in my estate
And Im gon shine like Im supposed to antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that   s a riff gon plead his case
The reason my powers here on earth
Salute the truth when the prophet say

Money and power the maker of marriages
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Tell me somethin
You mothafuckas cant tell me nothin
Id rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin bullets reapin what you sow
And stackin up the footage livin on the go
And sleepin in a villa
Sippin from a Grammy and walkin in the buildin
Diamond in the ceilin marble on the floors
Beach inside the window peekin out the window
Baby in the pool godfather goals
Only Lord knows Ive been goin hammer
Dodgin paparazzi freakin through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters Brock wearin sandals
Yoga on a Monday stretchin to Nirvana
Watchin all the snakes curvin all the fakes
Phone never on I dont conversate
I dont compromise I just penetrate
Sex money murder   these are the breaks
These are the times level number 
Look up in the sky  is on the way
Sentence on the way killings on the way
Motherfucker I got winners on the way
You aint shit without a body on your belt
You aint shit without a ticket on your plate
You aint sick enough to pull it on yourself
You aint rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate gonna be our faith
Peace to the world let it rotate
Sex money murder   our DNA

Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Me and my niggas tryna get it ya bish
Hit the house lick tell me is you wit it ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know its vacant ya bish
Dreams of livin life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasnt cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond Let It Burn came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen ya bish
Park the car then we start rhymin ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You lookin like a easy comeup ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from ya bish
And thats a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

Pick your poison tell me what you doin
Everybody gon respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever

And I been hustlin all day

Through canals and alleyways just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And thats just how I feel nah nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
Thats just how I feel nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
Thats just how I feel nah nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
Thats just how I feel nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich

Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Dreams of livin life like rappers do
Bump that new E after school

Earl Stevens had us thinkin rational
Back to reality we poor ya bish
Another casualty at war ya bish
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head
He said one day Ill be on tour ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But Ima purchase when that day is jerkin
Pull off at Churchs with Pirellis skirtin
Gang signs out the window ya bish
Hopin all of em offend you ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon crash it when nobodys home

Verse  Jay Rock
Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus dont miss them stockings
Liquors spillin pistols poppin
Bakin soda YOLA whippin
Aint no turkey on Thanksgivin
My homeboy just domed a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day Im hustlin
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter nem
Get the fuck up out my way bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys dont see my stash
If they do tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass aint cut
Them serpents lurkin Blood
Bitches sellin pussy niggas sellin drugs
But its all good
Broken promises steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your Js and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin shaded under a money tree

Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist

I can feel a new life I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me its painless
You dont know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

You live in a world you livin behind the mirror

The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital I know you had to

To die in a pitiful vain tell me a watch and a chain

Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds

Talkin out his head philosophin on what the Lord had done
He said KDot can you pray for me
It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed show me how to overcome
He was lookin for some closure
Hopin I could bring him closer
To the spiritual my spirit do know better but I told him
I cant sugarcoat the answer for you this is how I feel
If somebody kill my son that mean somebody gettin killed
Tell me what you do for love loyalty and passion of
All the memories collected moments you could never touch
Ill wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
Ill catch a nigga leavin service if thats all I got
Ill chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like Bitch I did that
Aint no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I cant even keep the peace dont you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister touch my woman
Touch my daddy touch my niece
Touch my nephew touch my brother

Homicidal thoughts Donald Trumps in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin
Pass the gin I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in you Crippin or you married to Blood
Ill ask again     oops accident
Its nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles then tell Fox to be scared of us

Im talkin about dark room perfume go go
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up you aint never gotta say shit
Uh and I know your taste is
A little bit hmm high maintenance
Uh everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
Youre in the mood for empathy theres blood in my pen
Better yet where your friends and em
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And yall curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party she wanna go and party
Nigga dont approach her with that Atari
Nigga that aint good game homie sorry
They say conversation rule a nation I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
Less I write it down for real PS

I was tryna put you on game put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it maybe one day
When you figure out youre gonna need someone
When you figure out its alright here in the city
And you dont run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice poetic justice
You were so new to this life but goddamn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress ooh
Good God what you doin that walk for
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write em down for real PS

Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin sure my punctuation curve every letter heres true
Livin my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
Im talkin poetic justice poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb its you lookin in the mirror
Love is not just a verb its you lookin for it maybe
Call me crazy we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference its coherent I can hear it

Verse 
I never knew a luh luhluh a love like this
Gotta be somethin for me to write this
Queen I aint seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit lets spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I aint gon assault them    cause I probably did it too
Because of you feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light
But they cant handle the glare
You know I aint the type to walk around with matchin shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest
And hurt you the most
They say the end is near its important that we close
To the most high
Regardless of what happen on Him lets rely
Hook

Verse 
Its important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
Theres so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But thats fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi nights moon you my light
If Heaven had a height you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop through you I see that all
Lets stick to understandin and we wont fall
For better or worse times I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family love aint simple
Why cant it be anything worth havin you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It dont take a whole day to recognize sunshine

Its kind of fresh you listen to more than hiphop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop

Thinkin you fresh suggestin beats I should rhyme to
At times when Im lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when its time to
My hearts dictionary defines you its love and happiness
Truthfully its hard tryin to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex aint gon keep you
But as my equal its how I must treat you
As my reflection in light Ima lead you
And whatevers right Ima feed you

Verse 
I met this girl when I was  years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money those studs was miccheckin her
But I respected her she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her turn on the air for her
And just cool out cool out and listen to her
Sittin on a bone wishin that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be then it would be
   Cause we related physically and mentally
And she was fun then Id be geeked when shed come around
Slim was fresh joe when she was underground
Original pure untampered a down sister
Boy I tell you I miss her

Verse 
Now periodically I would see
Ol girl at the clubs and at the house parties
She didnt have a body but she started gettin thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin the violence
About my people she was teachin me
By not preachin to me but speakin to me
In a method that was leisurely so easily I approach
She dug my rap thats how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast and that was cool
Cause around the same time I went away to school
And Im a man of expandin so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in LA
And she did stud she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the problack was goin out of style
She said Afrocentricity was of the past
So she got into R&B hiphouse bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and its all good
I wasnt salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her she was becomin wellrounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin fun not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung

Verse 
I mightve failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials shes universal
She used to only swing it with the innercity circle
Now she be in the burbs lookin rock and dressin hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin bout poppin Glocks servin rocks and hittin switches
Now shes a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches
Always smokin blunts and gettin drunk
Tellin me sad stories now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest before she got into showbiz
I did her not just to say that I did it
But Im committed girl hes committed but so many niggas hit it
That shes just not the same lettin all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin her and takin her to the sewer
But Ima take her back hopin that the shit stop
   Cause who Im talkin about yall is hiphop

Justice for all just aint specific enough
One son died his spirit is revisitin us
True and livin livin in us resistance is us
Thats why Rosa sat on the bus

Selma is now for every man woman and child
Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
They marched with the torch we gon run with it now
Never look back we done gone hundreds of miles
From dark roads he rose to become a hero
Facin the league of justice his power was the people
Enemy is lethal a king became regal
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle
The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
We sing our music is the cuts that we bleed through
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history
No one can win the war individually
It takes the wisdom of the elders and young peoples energy
Welcome to the story we call victory
The comin of the Lord my eyes have seen the glory
Chorus
One day when the glory comes
It will be ours it will be ours
One day when the war is won

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Its a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me
Verse 
Yeah you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldnt sleep cause on the real he had five kids
Live nigs real niggas express and taste it
At crap games black dames and big faces
Cases in court fam showing love and support
You and your babys mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
Thats why we dont know how til were older men
If love is a place Ima go again
At least now now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then youre home again
Ive seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he dont want to end

Verse 
Its all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love hoping itd become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Trying to find herself again much of that shed have gave
Love can free us to it some of us react as a slave
Funny we love em more when theyre relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw is he actin afraid
Everybody loves sun why do I attract shade
Heard of the love of money but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so shed understand
What it is to be loved by a man

Two tattoos one read No Apologies
The other said Love is Cursed by Monogamy

So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See theyll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See thats that privately owned prison
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
Ill fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Yall bout to turn shit up

And all I want is what I cant buy now
Cause I aint got the money on me right now

So Imma need a little more time now
Cause I aint got the money on me right now
And I thought you could wait
Yeah I thought you could wait
These bitches surroundin me
All want something out me

Would be lost without me
We couldve been somebody
Thought youd be different bout it
Now I know you not it
So lets get on with it
Verse 
We couldve been somebody
stead you had to tell somebody
Lets take it back to the first party
When you tried your first molly
And came out of your body

Running naked down the lobby
And you was screamin that you love me
Before the limelight tore ya
Before the limelight stole ya
Remember we were so young
When I would hold you
Before the blood on the leaves
I know there aint wrong with me
Something strange is happenin
Verse 
You couldve been somebody
We couldve ugh we couldve been somebody
Or was it on the first party

Verse  JAYZ
Look I apologize often womanize
Took for my child to be born see through a womans eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song I dont deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
Please come back to Rome you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
   Please pick up the phone pick up the phone   
I said    Dont embarrass me    instead of    Be mine   
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your st birthday
You matured faster than me I wasnt ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for all the stillborns cause I wasnt present
Your body wouldnt accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say Im all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin of all the time you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize
Chorus Hannah Williams
Im never gonna treat you
Im never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh
Verse  JAYZ
I apologize our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay til our backs burn
Were supposed to laugh til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didnt know
I promised I cried I couldnt hold
I suck at love I think I need a doover
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over what if you over my shit
Chorus Hannah Williams
Im never gonna treat you
Im never gonna treat you like I should

And if my children knew
I dont even know what I would do
If they aint look at me the same
I would probly die with all the shame
You did what with who
What good is a m  nage    trois when you have a soulmate
You risked that for Blue
If I wasnt a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blues tooth the tooth fairy didnt pay

I bought my Momma a Benz and bought my boo boo a Jag
And now Im rolling in a ninetrizzay El DoRag
Just remember who changed your mind

Shackled from head to toe

Cause its the OG DOdoubleG LBC
Mad dogging niggas cause I dont care
Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard thats where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks just in case the war pops off
Cause you cant tell whats next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably wont make it to see twentytwo
I put that on my Momma Ima ride for you Baby Boo

Lodi Dodi we likes to party

For all my doggs keepin yall in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Cause its cool when you cause the cozy conditioning
Which we create cause thats our mission
So listen close to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around  oclock in the morning
I gave myself a strech up a morning yawn and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said Um mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top dog of them all
There was a ruffle duffle five minutes it lasted
The mirror said You are you conceited bastard
Well thats true Thats why we never have no beef
So I slipped on my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file for my fingernails
Im true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnsons Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now Im fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks with my allblue Chucks
Stepped out the house stopped short oh no
I went back in I forgot my Indo
Then I dilly dally I ran through an alley
I bumped into this smoker named Sally from the Valley
This was a girl playing hardtoget
So I said Whats wrong cause she looked upset
She said um
Nancy Flethcer
Its all because of you Im feeling sad and blue
You went away now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so how much youll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me
Verse 
Damn now what was I to do
Shes crying over me and she was feelin blue
I said Um dont cry dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys
Her mean mother steps then says to me Hi
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said What was goin on
I tried to break it up I said Stop it just leave her
She said If I cant smoke none she cant either
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um they gave chase they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbin my dick
And saying
Why dont you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
Ill give you all my love today
Doggy Doggy Doggy cant you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg your love is here to stay
And on and on and on she kept going
The bitch been around before my mother born
I said Cheer up and I gave her a hit
I said You cant have me Im too young for you bitch
She said No youre not then she starts cryin
I says Im  she says Stop lyin
I says I am go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy I cant be your lover

Girl why is you lying girl why you Mufasa
Yeah mi casa su casa got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes now the flow is so lava
Yeah we spit that saliva iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra or we let bygones be bygones
My God you pay for your friends Ill take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies why I feel so the opposite

I used to care what people thought but now I care more
I mean nobody out heres got it figured out
So therefore Ive lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not its worth it so insecure no ones perfect
We spend it with no shame we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine or leave it like Cobain
And when Im long gone whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs got a Lambo like LeBrons mom
And no matter where all of my friends go Emily Fam and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk at least I think so cant tell
Cause when them checks clear theyre not here
Cause they dont care its kinda sad but Im laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping Im glad that it happened I mean it
Between us I think theres something special and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand even if you dont understand hold up

Im sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that this songs coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling you start crying
I come over Im inside you
I cant find you the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isnt half bad
The text say that Its not fair
Thats code for Hes not here

Im paranoid that these girls want something from me
And its hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin out over a worse fate
She on time but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesomegood problems

Askin him if she wanna play games
With the Super Smash Brothers but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through

Respond to this we can squash the beef right now like sausages
Chillin with my nwords say it like a white kid

So she dont get embarrassed my dick is made of carrots
Bunnies wantin to be fed it I meant honeys oh forget it

In the back of a bush like Gavin Rossdales drummer
Yeah my stingers in her flower I hope she let me pollinate
Workin hard as shit yeah this beat is made from concentrate
Nigga cant you tell that my sample of Adele

An elephant never forgets so my dick remembers everything
Green inside your wallet is that pussy open sesame

Hangin with some girls I never seen before

Wonder if youre bendin over backwards for someone else
Wonder if youre rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin nasty for someone else

Why you always touching road
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl you was in the zone
Yeah you should just be yourself
Right now youre someone else

They just mad    cause I got the Midas touch
You love her then you gotta give the world to her

Ho shut the fuck up

I learn from what Ive been through
Im finna do what I didnt do
And still waking up like the rents due
Not complicated its simple
I got sexy ladies a whole Benzfull
And to them hoes Im everything   everything but gentle
But I still take my time man I guess Im just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit thats old fashion
Nigga see what Im saying no closed caption
I paint pics see the shit good sex need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth drink a fifth load the nine
Leave you split in the half smoke a half need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got  problems but a bitch aint one
I got  problems getting rich aint one
Like I got trust issues
Im sorry for the people Ive pushed out
Im the type to have a bulletproof condom
And still gotta pull out
But thats just me and I aint perfect
I aint a saint but I am worth it
If its one thing I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it aint working

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that Im all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasnt you you would be dissin you dawg
Damn okay from that perspective
I see what youre talkin bout no way to soften that
Cause me I was tryna find out where I lost em at
But maybe I aint lose em at all
Maybe I keep movin forward and theyre just stagnant
They aint movin at all
But when they need a favor who do they call
Maybe Im searchin for the problems
Askin what was said and who was involved
Too focused on peoples feedback and provin em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit no matter whose foot its on
These days feel like Im squeezin in em
Whoever wore em before just wasnt thinkin big enough
Im bout to leave em with em
Cause if I run in the game in these man the seams are splittin
No pun intended but theyre smellin defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it who meetin me there
They tell him that hes talkin crazy but he doesnt care
Bein humble dont work as well as bein aware
Listen up boy youre better off eavesdroppin
We already got spring  poppin
PND droppin Repsup P droppin
Majid Jordan droppin OB droppin not to mention me droppin
Feel like we paid the refs off man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah been on the move like the lease is up
And I cant even name one person thats keepin up
Damn fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself how do we match up now
Cause Im only  and Im only gettin better
If I havent passed you yet watch me catch up now for real

We dont believe you cause we the people
Are still here in the rear ayo we dont need you
You in the killingoffgoodyoungnigga mood
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal were liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She dont love me she make money she dont study that
She gon give it to me aint gon tell me run it back
She gon take the brain to wetter plains she spit on that
The doors have signs with dont try to rhyme with
VH has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary Id probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin commas
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here now its not a shit hole

Verse  Phife Dawg
You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians
Fuck yall know about true competition
Thats like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin
The only one whos hitting are the ones thats currently spittin
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world thats equal for women with no division
Boy I tell you thats vision
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten
The Tribe be the best in they division
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
Who can come back years later still hit the shot

Now heres a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother tell your father send a telegram
Im like an energizer cause you see I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack thats where youre dead wrong
I slayed that buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
Youd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MCs
Cause I love it when you wack MCs despise me
They get vexed I roll next cant none contest me
Im just a fly MC whos five foot three and very brave
On top remaining no home training cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see my auras positive I dont promote no junk
See Im far from a bully and I aint a punk

How far must you go to gain respect Umm
Well its kind of simple just remain your own
Or youll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number fourthousandandeighty
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back cause I think they smoke crack

I float like gravity never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause Ill always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still dont know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your {ass}
I never half step cause Im not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name aint Special Ed
So wont you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking its all about me
Even though deep in my heart it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black youre buggin out
Verse  QTip
Zulu Nation brothers last creation
Minds get flooded ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across so bust the floss
As I go in between the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work umm
As I crack the monotone
Children of the jazz so get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they cant do rap
For its Abstract original
You cant get your own and thats pitiful
I know Id be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B but I cant and thats bugged

Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding always surrounding
Pulsing just like a migraine pounding
You dont really fret you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling of absolute tense
You soar off to another world deep in your mind
But people seem to take that as being unkind
Oh yo hes acting stank really on a regal
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nikes
If a crowd is in my realm Im saying  mic please
Hiphop is living cant yank the plug
If you do the result will end up kind of bugged
Verse  QTip
Yo I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road see I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
Im the type of brother with the crazy extended hand kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause youre feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
Its your brain against my mind for those about to boot out

Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug

A life filled with fun thats what I love

We like the breeze flow straight out of our lids
Then they got moved by these hardrock Brooklyn kids
Us floor rush when the DJs booming classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hiphop records
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthoughtof dimensions
Whys it so fly cause hiphop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light bluesuede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin chunky rhythms right down ya block
We be to rap what key be to lock

When hip is just the norm
Cause Planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all its forms
The kinks the dance the prints in all the shirts
My grandmother told my Mama that its Africa at work
On vibes we freak them universal beats
You find it at the spot you hit at ends of every week
We twist exist to spin the maddest hits
Up here funk is our neighbour so we paid her a visit
The lip we sip cant house the nine zips
For rock we cant do nothing for this we come equipped
Off disc off tape rap blasting til from eight
The really truly fat the fly on the flip
Cocoa gotta know how Planets gotta roll
Speak the mega cool get funky as a goal
Its calm relax were only some new jacks
That acts from the funk but dont play the role
Where you from
Verse  Doodlebug
Weekend Dig Plans got Ts where Im from
Where Im from its Clarence  where Im from
Where Im from brothers took the beats and got fly
Why Thats most asked by  where Im from
Faking the funk you get did
Projects tenements pyramids where Im from
We living off the boom boom crack
Its that hiphop rockers jazz when I max
Peace be the greeting of the insect tribe
Pestilent forces cant catch the vibe
We live to love and we love to rock mics
We speak in ghetto tongue cause ghettos the life
Food for thought so get a buffet plate
The lyrics are so fat you might gain weight
So just watch me step alone into the sunset
Left foot right foot  mic check
Brewing funk inside my soul kitchen
So pull up a chair heres a bib have a listen
Of hardhead intervene damn I know youre fluent
Yeah cause Doodle aint having it and Butterfly knew it
Where you from
Verse  Ladybug
Venus acts a fool at the square right yeah
Doctors engineer in a pair right yeah
Hiphop made a point last year right yeah
But Planets is the joint this year right yeah
Planets got the dubs and live to grasshop
Duck out from the fuzz that sweat the hiphop
Rising like we foam get it from the dome
Im from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
We can get a kit without no thread
Feeling funky beats go straight to the head
Fall into a club dig on what we love
It be past six before we reach bed
Butter freaks on relics we say those are fat
Doodle Mecc and Silk the quad where its at
We need to stack a sack for rap to take us dap
So we treat our clips just like busting caps
Rip it till dawn kick it till dawn
HipHop is the fix or else we be gone
People thought they canned it
Rap is not by bandits
Digable Planets got it going on

Fresh from Flatbush in my baggy booster Guess
Style is type ease busted cami fatigues
 leagues of Black so whats up
Can we avenue slide player style ghetto walk
To the East son wild Crooklyn New York
Creamy kids yell Smith and Wesson when Im blessing
The angular slang blow spots bang   eleven
Hanging like bats cause the twelveinch wax
Say Scorpio
And my hair say fro
And my blood say bro
My clique say ayo
Make sparks from the barrel mental pistol
To the depths I dive seems lunar like aqua
The cool blast mega we black we wildflowers
Scott La Rock had em all
I gots to ball and roll with little Panthers through these project halls
The threecolor flag cant hold my baggy sag
 to Omega
Black motion is ocean style
Slick in my ways since days of deep classics
Now glamor boys want to be triple phatted
But Im slicker this year
Im slicker this year
Bridge
East born
Beats Tannoys on
Lovely all over the city
In your tape deck blasting
Rs and the phat fly sneakers
And the camouflage

Doodlebug
I was raised in the ways of the Manchu Clan
And five elements posture take a Bboy stance
With the gold front shining baggy pants sagging
This Brooklyn styling got the fly girls smiling
But Im climbing finding new ways of rhyming
Not living like a star its strictly bout surviving
Diving deep into the grooves of the ghetto
This downtown flavor shines from many angles
Yes the notorious with rhymes so glorious
The Manchu Monkey over flunkies is victorious
Rappers be boring us with rhymes so conventional
Dazed and amazed when they hear the three dimensional
Lyrical skills of the insect in motion
Coasting down Fulton with a bag of magic potion
Now Im rolling with the seven and the crescents
Puffing some expression
Manifesting todays lessons
Stressing the fact that Im solar guaranteed to go far
Cause the mind is interstellar
Still peace like that so have no fear
But Im slicker this year
Im slicker this year
Refrain
To the queens everywhere making money
To the whole SI making money
To the lumpen mass making money
Dont forget about your peeps when ya making money

Catch me at a hot spot with the dusk daughters
We bouncing moving within the true circles
We played you made you change straight New Yorked you

Cool are you slicker this year

Verse  Ishmael Butler
Butterfly searching for a relax
Pulling from the jazz stacks cause its Sunday
On the air is incense sounds to the ceiling
Tried to get this feeling since Monday
Looking out the window watching all the people go
Bugging off a funny vibe cause now it seems theyre equal
Wonder what would Trane say wonder what my pop say
Bugging off the calmness in the Apple
Who me Im cooling in New York
Im chilling in New York
The hoods is on my block and the brothers at the court
The baseball hats is on and the projects is calm
Dreamtimes extended and highly recommended
But early birds like mes up checking out the scene
The early worms jog forget about your job
Just come dig the essence while the decadence is hidden
When people act like people the theory is in pigeon
If you know the norm its like Hades transformed
On Sundays early hours the city sprouts its flowers
So get with the rhythms while you getting with the Planets
Vibe off the jams but dont take em for granted just chill
Refrain
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
Verse  Mary Ann Vieira and Craig Irving
We venture through the streets in search of funky beats
Extensive is the travels and its heavy on the sneaks
Ye its kicking out the speakers of the Sunday morning jeepers
My man do Planets do it lovely
Am I my brothers keeper
We foot it to the park where the swoon units walk
And sit with the phoenicians digging on musicians
Hanging with the rebels sipping on a Snapple
Bugging with my crew just tripping in the Apple
You be thinking peace when youre vibing with your flock
But you be thinking damn everybody got a Glock
If you got some beef please express that in silence
Or else violence
But right here is the life its the children of the concrete
Living off the fruits and the functions of the fat beats
Hiphops all around the members is growing
Please dig on the sounds cause the good vibes they snowing so chill
Refrain
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
Verse  Ishmael Butler
Wake up praying that the games on
Maybe its the Running Rebs maybe its the Knicks
Maybe its a rerun of an old TV show
Like Hawaii  or karate flicks
Maybe if the phone rings Butterfly will take wings
Speaking on some cool things fronting like I cope
Born unto flat ground now Im chilling shaky ground
Reaching for Pacific Heights Sunday is my rope dig it
Sundays to relax
Sundays to relax
Some Sunday morning drama is calling up my Mama
The hot line is in I guess the silvers knew the deal
Vibing off the jams of the crews on Sugarhill
Lay around and think aint nothing to do
Checking out some Fromm some Sartre Camus
Mingus Ah Um damn Roach can drum
The DPs are life there they go here they come
Its time to grab some loot put on the Timber boots
Checking out some Dalis like Tasha and Kamali
New York is a museum with its posters and graffiti
If youre in the city on Sunday
Come check me get with me
Refrain
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot

Butterfly
It was  on a beautiful th day of July
There was not a cloud to speak of so the orange sun hung
Lonely in the sky
I lay prone in my catbeat home
Listening to fine nappy Jackie and his jazzcats horn
Sliding in a tape of Bird on Verve when suddenly rang my phone
Hey Butterfly the voice said
Slip on some duds comb out your fro and slide on down to my pad
The vibe here is very pleasant and I truly request your presence
A problem of great magnitude has arose
And as we speak it grows
Damn what could it be I thought
A juice I bought and rolled on down to her spot
Seeing bros I know slapping fives I arrived and pressed G
And there was Nikki
Lookin some kind of sad with tears fallin from her eyes
She sat me down and dug my frown and began to run it down
You remember my boyfriend Sid that fly kid who I love
Well our love was often a verb and spontaneity has brought a third
But due to our youth and economic state we wish to terminate
About this we dont feel great but baby thats how it is
But the feds have dissed me
They ignored and dismissed me
The prolifers harass me outside the clinic
And call me a murderer now thats hate
So needless to say were in a mental state of debate
Hey beautiful bird I said digging her somber mood
The fascists are some heavy dudes
They dont really give a damn about life
They just dont want a woman to control her body
Or have the right to choose
But baby that aint nothin
They just want a male finger on the button
Because if you say war they will send them to die by the score
Aborting mission should be your volition
But if Souter and Thomas have their way
Youll be standing in line unable to get Welfare while theyll be out
Hunting and fishing
It has always been around it will always have a niche
But theyll make it a privilege not a right
Accessible only to the rich
Hey Prolifers need to dig themselves
Because life doesnt stop after birth
And for a child born to the unprepared
It might even just get worse
The situation would surely change if they were to find themselves in it
Supporters of the HBomb and firebombing clinics
What type of shit is that Orwellian in fact
If Roe v Wade was overturned would not the desire remain intact
Leaving young girls to risk their healths
And doctors to botch and watch as they kill themselves
I dont want to sound macabre
But hey isnt it my job
To lay it on the masses and get them off their asses
To fight against these fascists
So whatever you decide make that move with pride
Sid will be there and so will I
An insect til I die
Rhythms and sounds
Spinning around
Confrontations
Across the nation
Your block
My block
Dreadlocks
What a shock
Land of the free
But not me not me
Cop
Alright boy
Butterfly
Ah man
Cop
Give you your rights
Butterfly
Here we go again
Cop
You have the right to remain silent
Ladybug
Hey Ish whats goin on

Give up the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you
Butterfly

Do you wish to give up the right to remain silent

Verse  Ladybug Mecca
So now lets let into in my pocket pack

And my thought to shakin up a few loose
Now I let my cause shoot KRS One
Cause we fade in and out are you swinging or coming

Verse  Doodlebug
I got Harlem on my mind Darren on my back
Brooklyn in my blood and butters on the track
I got insect thoughts catch the cool ways
Clouds of purple haze keep me in a daze
The jazz the jive the poetry
The style the lingo the bags of equality
Many different things try to get to me
But in a world of hard rock I keep my humility
The funkanaut from the kingdom of not
With galactic sure shot they cant wont dont stop
Flock to the rhythm I bring
Sing songs call survival on the Mingus revival
Scored the bass hit with my bugged out clique
Its Doodlebug give me love for a visual script
Sip the groove juice its kind of rough
Sevens never bluff I had enough eleven
Chorus
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right

Verse  Butterfly
In the east I rose
Froze in the pose
Of a land diseased
Flows that cooler summer breeze
Nikki did Kevins braids we got four in the Lac
As we swoop at warp seven holler dont crowd cats
Cause look corpie is the color and Butter he do it low
All you hear is poppers and rubber Im saying oh
Man we keep it popping on hot days
Shit I got the fish eggs dropping any block you dip
And I dazzle that mood with the cool out fool
Easing semiswerve to the curb like the do
Im fro blow got that right
Groove with soul and Im still spinnin
Cross  and indicate them something else
Blackest space deepest sea
Scoff My shits a natural high the man cant put no thing on me
Now catch me when my mind stretch out its astro black
Time reaching into end nappy afro blue
We Swing fightin out the corners
Do my thaaang like Huey with it nigga
Chorus
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right

Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right

The ticky ticky buzz the sun wakes the sky
I fumble through my fuzz and buzz Mr I
Tell him scoop the beats in the flying saucer kit
Meet me at the port with the nickel bags and shit
Tell my pops Im out earthbound with the crew
He said Butterfly may the boogie be with you
Left my moms a note with these quotes on a trunk
It says I split to Earth to resurrect the funk
A dozen Snapple pops and a little box of beats
Travelin through space with the funky funky beats
Stopped at Pluto to cop some petrol
Met some Klingons and got our things on
Cruisin warp  with Mr Wiggles in the mix
Hendrix passin peas star child get the fix
The saucer shook the heavens with the blooms and the blams
Because when we hit New York  shazam
We droppin like a comet and this Vulcan tried to Spock it
These martians tried to do it but knew they couldnt cop it
The others from our brother planet lands in the flesh
From up in sector  yes yall
Doodlebug
And its good to be here
When we landed up on lex
Stirrin up the ground with the sound of Doug E Fresh
And the hard rockin kids that did it for the black
With the Pumas on their feet and the bombers on their back
We learned it and we earned it so you know you got to hand it
We planned it when we left how to freak it and to slam it
Add a Ladybug transformation is complete
For the metamorphosis from the box to the Jeep
Ladybug
And its good to be here
Gettin fly with the raps
We love it where we from but we kick it where we at
Bumpin out with somethin that pops and transcends
Dps baby its slim but not thin
In amongst the pebbles we rocks on your blocks
Soakin in the ghetto for kids that have not
Slappin on some skin when we slam check the cheers
So we greet their virgin ears with a kiss
Its so good to be here
All
We jazz up the streets to prove we have beats
Fat jazz fat style and the sound so sweet
And there aint no doubt that you got to check
Doodle Silk Butter Mecc
Its so good to be here
Butterfly
Yeah baby thats the style
The jazz can fill a club or papers by the pile
Just ask toy soldier toy soldier could of told you
At the boomin funk hut it was the Afro with the butt
So to the flam lovers that crowd in dark spots
So see em kick the lingo and grip that little crotch
Now we have arrived with crazy boogie sounds
Get yourself a mate todays to boogie down
This is all we know we feel it when we slams
You could hear the love it comes out in our jams
The hiphop diggin cats just deliverin the words
From the ghettodwellin youth to the bourgies in the burbs
And its good to be here
Butterfly
DPS forever hit ya with the live stuff

The noise that we made is blue in color sound
Toys who played my crew couldnt walk the new ground
Or chalk the new sound
A bop like Teddy Charles was burning
When I excurse on excursions
Arriving at the doors of mind shores of seas
Burnt you with degrees solarly
Plus my leather jacket go acid disappear in the wisp
In the mist with a fist
Proletariat Cadilac steering it
Fro soul gold Panther crew grab our poppers
Now Im making bacon
Still saying wa ah salaam ah lakum
Fresh joints we make em like water
Butter rap treasures at my leisure whatever whatever
So I gave my mind a pound cause yall we had it down
We symbolize the blessed and represent the rest
Grabs in my pockets I release my hot rockets
KB said What you give em I was like Mad rhythm
Thats my junk

See Marvin knew it and Sly knew it
Cube know it and now we do it outta Brooklyn
Outta sight brown sandals handlin MCs with angles
Commit to street corners where players be jayin

Peak you as you been there and float to them raps
Butterflys planets for the jam  Tracks

Whered they find the stuff to freak it like a wizard
Slick just like a lizard
Really weird or is it
Its just the logic from how we rocks it
Pop shock picks it up and drops its
We the synthesis of then and now melts
Channeled to the masses through a DJ and some felts
Long haired hippies Afro blacks
All get together across the tracks
Because when we shows up rhythm rolls up
Funk cannot be measured while the pleasure grows up
Life aint what it seems life is but a dream
Planets wreaking havoc is as constant as the rain
Yeah
Sample
The song is by some groovy cats
If you can dig
The cats you can dig the song
Yeah I can really dig how these cats get down with the

I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Verse  Chance The Rapper
Okie dokie alkie keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or hell go blow the loudy saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour Ill ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling fuck me
Two weeks shell be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy Tommy and Chuckie
And Chuck E Cheeses pizzas Jesus pieces sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddys yall taught me how to go hunting BLAM
Chorus  Chance the Rapper
Cigarettes on cigarettes my mama think I stank

Verse  Vic Mensa
I will smoke a little something but I dont inhale
Everywhere that I go everywhere they be asking hows it going
Say the goings well go figure Victors light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell all praise to the God
God knows hes a pro hes a pro like COINTEL
Check check mate check me take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldnt kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days they get so high
Burn trees smoke chlorophyll til they cant feel shit
Shitfaced faced it  hits on this L
Elevated train and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill miseducated my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad enough of that jazz
Asshole absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet Ice cubes in a bong
Rip brain dead take a tug and then pass

Verse  Twista
I could make a flow pitter patter with a patter pitter  juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
Thats the new principle sometimes Imma be about some hoes
Sometimes Imma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast Im the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
Cause Im addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me Im the ObiWan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like Im offa codeine low key
Dont be so judgmental even though Im reminiscing
If I dont know what I miss is
Ima end up figuring out that its home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and Im thanking
I need em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug and I cant cause Im stanking
Never too old for a spanking IGH

I never forged it or forfeited Im a force to be reconciled

You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn

Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water ugh

Clean up the streets so my daughter can have somewhere to play

Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I aint goin to hell or to Hillman
Igh Igh Igh Igh for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Cant stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous you dont know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man I dont even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Dosido
Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

Verse
Kicked off my shoes tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatchless necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah I inhaled who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young just turned older than him
I seen it happen I seen it happen I see it always
He still be screaming I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And Im hungry Im just not that thirsty
As of late all my verses seem not so versey
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back like Thats not your jersey
Stressin pullin my hair out hoping I dont get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I dont get sick
Making all of this money hoping I dont get rich
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth dont rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls is that appealing to you
From your cubicle desktop what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Couldve threw him an alleyoop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vics still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that antiviolence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And Im only getting greedier
And Im still Mr Youmedia
And I still cant find Talent
And Im still choosing classmates that wouldnt fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks Im good enough
And Mama Jan still dont take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

You couldnt stand me I couldnt stand you
You said Im steady playin but you steady playin too

But in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me too worried bout Frooties and Chews
Til I found out all the shawdys with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

Bentley Spurs and Phantom Jordan fadeaway

Verse  Tyler the Creator
The big eared bandit is tossin all his manners
In a bag and wrappin them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says Catch up nigga it looks like an accident
Um flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like shes been mimicking a panda
Its the dark skinned nigga kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic contradicting dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semenscented cheetah printed tee
In that Preme five panel Ill repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normalass past like I cheated on my team
Its me Tried to get that nigga but Golf Wang
See he did come back though
Verse  Hodgy Beats
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin you own your opponent is a defeatin bonus
Im Zeus to a Kronos cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin
Im on my Robin Hood shit robbing in the hood
Whips drugs jewels and your pet Im stealin your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette soldiers lace the fuckin boot
And salute like the troop when they shoot you gon brrrooop
Its KILLHodgy nigga stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my KoolAid Juice
Verse  Left Brain
Whats up bitch
Hodgy got the juice I got the gin

I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup uh and her ass fat
Dont be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga Im tryna smoke bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame Talking bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you dont salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia bitch dont get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up throw em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl yo I dont really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus
Verse  Mike G
What the fuck is caution
Often I leave em flossing in KAWS exes next to coffins
Lost in translation the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
Thats great Im home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees huh
Im getting blazed thinking bout those days
I had the top off the GT like toupees
One finger in the air alls fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you dont even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham rock LA to Harlem
If you say Get em Mike G then I got em
One man squadron nigga Im a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or its gonna be real
OF til I OD and I probably will uh
Verse  Domo Genesis
Its still Mr SmokeaLottaPot get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop do I love her Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin drop
Bitch Im in the zone stand alone like Macaulay Cock
Ive been runnin blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now Im all grown same song just a different waltz
Fire what I talk but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit your mistress on my hit list
And Im lifted til Im stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin area
Blood clots give me five feet fore I bury ya
Suicide flow let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team ho nigga wassup
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog Im a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short break it down couple pounds roll it up
Interlude Frank Ocean
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga

Verse  Frank Ocean
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends smoke a gram of that haze
Bro easy on the ounce thats a lot for a day
But just enough for a week my nigga what can I say
Im high and Im bi wait I mean Im straight
Imma get you this wine the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time Morris and Day
Course you know the vibes just as fly as the rhymes
On the song cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Interlude Jasper Dolphin
Goddammit this rapping is stupid and its hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go
Verse  Jasper Dolphin
Hey its Jasper not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show so I guess Im an actor
Pot head halfbaked lookin like Chappelle
Rollin up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang nigga so I still dont give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat
Interlude Jasper Dolphin & Earl Sweatshirt
Hah nigga came through with a bar real quick
Just for the bitches little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it Wolf Gang
Yeah fuck that
Verse  Earl Sweatshirt
Look for contrast heres a pair of lips
Swallowin sarapin and settin fire to sheriffs whips
Whoops whoops Fuckin AllAmerican terrorist
Crushin rapper larynx to feed em a fuckin carrot stick
And me I just spent a year Ferrisin
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow tight line might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit grimey get dinero type
Feral fuckin illapparelwearin pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin fridges tippin over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixtyday chips from fuckin awesome anonymous
Call him bloated til he show em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin hot as dunkin scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada drivin drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova Im rollin over the novices
And roamin through the forest and spittin cold as his porridge is
Stay gold til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again lord of lips
Bored of this forklift the tippy top best under  list
Stormin the gate ensurin the bass
Scorchin leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me we savages half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who dont give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact your swagger is tacky
So see me you cant like Crunchy Black catchin a taxi
Uh back like lateral passin
With that motherfuckin gladiator manner of rappin
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi please
Verse  Tyler the Creator
OF shit thats all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin down Fax Wolf Gang run the fuckin block
Storefront knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape and my shoes
Um I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later for our label yeah we own it
I started an empire I aint even old enough
To drink a fucking beer Im tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggas in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the nword
And the ones that got called weird fag bitch nerd
Cause you was into jazz kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we aint actin right
Always try to turn our fuckin color into black and white
But theyll never change em never understand em
Radicals my anthem turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin bein mad as fuck
Just admit not only are we talented were rad as fuck bitches

Put a pic with me on the gram now you popping
Where your ass was at when I was trapping in the store
Had to struggle to get where Im at and sell dope
Jackie Chan moves got game in the choke

Lawyers and the commissary ain   t gon    pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom
Where your ass was at I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain   t got no choice
Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I   m selfmade selfish with my women selfemployed
I   ll buy the neighbors house if they complain about the noise

Fuck where you was at I had the  on my shoulders

Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Brace yourself Ill take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how Im slingin crack or move cocaine
This is culdesac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant but the stress that weighin on your brain
It was me L Boog and Yan Yan YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly wavin yo hand out the window     check yourself
Uh Warriors and Conans hope euphoria can slow dance
With society the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a lightskinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin that he did it
But ever since that day I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door fuck is up
Fuck you shootin for if you aint walkin up you fuckin punk
Pickin up the fuckin pump pickin off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin from AKs ARs Aye yall   duck
Thats what Momma said when we was eatin that free lunch
Aw man goddamn all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in  fuck yo truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Aint no peace treaty just piecin BGs up to preapprove
Bodies on top of bodies IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley make sure your colors correct
Make sure youre corporate or theyll be callin your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens that shit aint no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial I guess

Wake yo punkass up
It aint nothin but a Compton thang
Gyeah real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
Smoke somethin nigga
Hood Sup Cuz
It aint nothin but a Compton thang
Gyeah how we do
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin in the living room of my mommas pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin
In fact I got fired cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin at the mouth
I was straight tweakin the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick aka Comptons Human Sacrifice
Interlude MC Eiht

Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One times crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra Rosecrans Bullis its Compton
Verse  MC Eiht
Im still in the hood loc yeah thats cool
Shit the hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah thats like me I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drivebys in the hood lately shit
Couple of IVs with the fuckin spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew Im finna slay the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy hearts turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip yeah
Trip we in the hood still
So loc grab a strap cause yeah its so real yeah
Deal with the outcome a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grands where a mothafucka stand
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen would you believe me
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief
And its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage
Kill em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn they vandalizin the option
Of livin a lie drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin and drive
Hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen coward the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit a price on his head the tithes
Probably go to the projects I
Live inside the belly of the rough Compton USA
Made Me an Angel on Angel Dust what

All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane

As the window open I release

Money and power the maker of marriages

Id rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin bullets reapin what you sow
And stackin up the footage livin on the go
And sleepin in a villa
Sippin from a Grammy and walkin in the buildin
Diamond in the ceilin marble on the floors
Beach inside the window peekin out the window
Baby in the pool godfather goals
Only Lord knows Ive been goin hammer
Dodgin paparazzi freakin through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters Brock wearin sandals
Yoga on a Monday stretchin to Nirvana
Watchin all the snakes curvin all the fakes
Phone never on I dont conversate
I dont compromise I just penetrate
Sex money murder   these are the breaks
These are the times level number 
Look up in the sky  is on the way
Sentence on the way killings on the way
Motherfucker I got winners on the way
You aint shit without a body on your belt
You aint shit without a ticket on your plate
You aint sick enough to pull it on yourself
You aint rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate gonna be our faith

Dreams of livin life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasnt cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond Let It Burn came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen ya bish

The only thing we had to free our mind

And thats a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

Through canals and alleyways just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And thats just how I feel nah nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
Thats just how I feel nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
Thats just how I feel nah nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch

Another casualty at war ya bish
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head
He said one day Ill be on tour ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But Ima purchase when that day is jerkin

I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day Im hustlin
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter nem
Get the fuck up out my way bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys dont see my stash
If they do tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass aint cut
Them serpents lurkin Blood
Bitches sellin pussy niggas sellin drugs
But its all good
Broken promises steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your Js and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin shaded under a money tree

Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist

I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me its painless
You dont know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

You live in a world you livin behind the mirror
I know what you scared of
The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital I know you had to
This shit is vital I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain tell me a watch and a chain

Rather a seasonal name
Ill let the people know this is somethin you can blame

You aint heard the Coast like this in a long time

Hide your feelings hide your feelings

Talk too motherfuckin much I got my drink I got my music

Verse 
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin he was mobbin way belligerent and drunk
Talkin out his head philosophin on what the Lord had done
He said KDot can you pray for me
It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed show me how to overcome
He was lookin for some closure
Hopin I could bring him closer
To the spiritual my spirit do know better but I told him
I cant sugarcoat the answer for you this is how I feel
If somebody kill my son that mean somebody gettin killed
Tell me what you do for love loyalty and passion of
All the memories collected moments you could never touch
Ill wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
Ill catch a nigga leavin service if thats all I got
Ill chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like Bitch I did that
Aint no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I cant even keep the peace dont you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister touch my woman
Touch my daddy touch my niece
Touch my nephew touch my brother
You should chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact Im bout to speak at this convention

This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Hail Mary Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us
Its murder on my street your street back streets
Wall Street corporate offices
Banks employees and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts Donald Trumps in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin
Pass the gin I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in you Crippin or you married to Blood
Ill ask again     oops accident
Its nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists et cetera et cetera
Americas reflections of me thats what a mirror does
Chorus Bono
Its not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look ar

Verse  Kendrick Lamar
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up you aint never gotta say shit

You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
Youre in the mood for empathy theres blood in my pen
Better yet where your friends and em
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And yall curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party she wanna go and party
Nigga dont approach her with that Atari
Nigga that aint good game homie sorry
They say conversation rule a nation I can tell

I really hope you play this cause ol girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these oneoff vacations youve been takin
Clearly a lot for me to take in it dont make sense
Young East African girl you too busy fuckin with your other man
I was tryna put you on game put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it maybe one day
When you figure out youre gonna need someone
When you figure out its alright here in the city
And you dont run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice poetic justice
You were so new to this life but goddamn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress ooh
Good God what you doin that walk for
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more

But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write em down for real PS

Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin sure my punctuation curve every letter heres true
Livin my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
Im talkin poetic justice poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb its you lookin in the mirror
Love is not just a verb its you lookin for it maybe
Call me crazy we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference its coherent I can hear it

There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Verse 
I never knew a luh luhluh a love like this
Gotta be somethin for me to write this
Queen I aint seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit lets spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I aint gon assault them    cause I probably did it too
Because of you feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light
But they cant handle the glare
You know I aint the type to walk around with matchin shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest
And hurt you the most
They say the end is near its important that we close
To the most high
Regardless of what happen on Him lets rely
Hook
There are times
When youll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines

Verse 
Its important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
Theres so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But thats fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi nights moon you my light
If Heaven had a height you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop through you I see that all
Lets stick to understandin and we wont fall
For better or worse times I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family love aint simple
Why cant it be anything worth havin you work at annually
Granted we known each other for some time
It dont take a whole day to recognize sunshine

Verse 
Its kind of fresh you listen to more than hiphop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when its time to
Thinkin you fresh suggestin beats I should rhyme to
At times when Im lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when its time to
My hearts dictionary defines you its love and happiness
Truthfully its hard tryin to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex aint gon keep you
But as my equal its how I must treat you
As my reflection in light Ima lead you
And whatevers right Ima feed you
Diggada diggada diggada diggadiggadada
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you peace

Verse 
I met this girl when I was  years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money those studs was miccheckin her
But I respected her she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her turn on the air for her
And just cool out cool out and listen to her
Sittin on a bone wishin that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be then it would be
   Cause we related physically and mentally
And she was fun then Id be geeked when shed come around
Slim was fresh joe when she was underground
Original pure untampered a down sister
Boy I tell you I miss her

Verse 
Now periodically I would see
Ol girl at the clubs and at the house parties
She didnt have a body but she started gettin thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin the violence
About my people she was teachin me
By not preachin to me but speakin to me
In a method that was leisurely so easily I approach
She dug my rap thats how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast and that was cool
Cause around the same time I went away to school
And Im a man of expandin so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in LA
And she did stud she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the problack was goin out of style
She said Afrocentricity was of the past
So she got into R&B hiphouse bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and its all good
I wasnt salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her she was becomin wellrounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin fun not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung

Verse 
I mightve failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials shes universal
She used to only swing it with the innercity circle
Now she be in the burbs lookin rock and dressin hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin bout poppin Glocks servin rocks and hittin switches
Now shes a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches
Always smokin blunts and gettin drunk
Tellin me sad stories now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest before she got into showbiz
I did her not just to say that I did it
But Im committed girl hes committed but so many niggas hit it
That shes just not the same lettin all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin her and takin her to the sewer
But Ima take her back hopin that the shit stop
   Cause who Im talkin about yall is hiphop

Justice for all just aint specific enough
One son died his spirit is revisitin us
True and livin livin in us resistance is us
Thats why Rosa sat on the bus
Thats why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up

Selma is now for every man woman and child
Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
They marched with the torch we gon run with it now
Never look back we done gone hundreds of miles
From dark roads he rose to become a hero
Facin the league of justice his power was the people
Enemy is lethal a king became regal
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle
The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
We sing our music is the cuts that we bleed through
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history
No one can win the war individually
It takes the wisdom of the elders and young peoples energy
Welcome to the story we call victory
The comin of the Lord my eyes have seen the glory
Chorus
One day when the glory comes
It will be ours it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure we will be sure

Acting all hard when he hardly like that
You gon    mess around and make me catch a body like that
Awwww don   t do it
Cause every song you make Joe is really ho music
I heard you said you wasn   t a bitch because you sing
You a bitch because you cling like a bitch that   s eighteen

Gotta reach that frequency

Verse 
Yeah you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldnt sleep cause on the real he had five kids
Live nigs real niggas express and taste it
At crap games black dames and big faces
Cases in court fam showing love and support
You and your babys mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
Thats why we dont know how til were older men
If love is a place Ima go again
At least now now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then youre home again
Ive seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he dont want to end

Verse 
Its all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love hoping itd become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Trying to find herself again much of that shed have gave
Love can free us to it some of us react as a slave
Funny we love em more when theyre relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw is he actin afraid
Everybody loves sun why do I attract shade
Heard of the love of money but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so shed understand
What it is to be loved by a man

May I ask in what way your life is contributing to society as you sit here day after day after day in this dark room stringing along on that stupid guitar Have you ever thought about that What are you doing for the world or for other people Day after day hour after hour night after night
Verse  Logic
Me and my homies just chillin feelin the vibes
This the time of our lives but many dont realize
Havin visions of livin on another level never signed to the Devil
The rebel that be fuckin round with the treble
Bumping Tribe in the system like penicillin motherfucker
Im killing spittin venomous never remember this its like a system
Say it then I do it I never missed em
Fuck em after I kissed em sit back and listen
My chain it glisten its like Im from another dimension
Did I mention my circles smaller than an intervention
Then some beautiful women tell me Im handsome
Then I snatch they heart and make the pussy the ransom
I fuck em until inside they belly burst
Stop it drop the beat and then we cue the verse
Spitting lyrics like how a Mac really disperse
Slaughter MCs and resurrect them when they in the hearse
They say I got too many styles bitch Ive been diverse
They scared to jump in the cypher I be all up in it first
My apologies but if youre after me then it gets worse
When I come through I spit voodoo and leave em cursed common logic

Aston Martin king Luther with dreams
The young Denzel the way I move through scenes
I   m like a preacher that once was a fiend
A story of change that came with wings
Pretty as the skyline the sky is my eyeline
Son of the most so from up high I shine
Suited in Prada stay mellow like lala
Young fresh with dollars ladies go gaga
I   m the cumlada top of the class
Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash
Given what I ask pure religion and cash
From the windows that open I   m raising my glass
Daylight beams night life schemes
This is my inception I   m writing my dreams
Immortal view of a star doing what I   m born to do
I see the blue sky see the Lords coming through

It all started with a dream I wanted to be Run   DMC
The Lord put the blessing upon the MC
O to the M dreams were spoken to him
Thats when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim
Open my eyes yes sir this is what Im made for
To go hard in the paint like D Wade or
D Rose from the same streets that we rose
International heroes at world primos
Red carpet magic taking pictures with the president
Told him for health care my music is the medicine
My name holds weight I am never hesitant
Different state resident this is hood elegance
SLS classic pursuing my passion
NOVA Fashion now Im Oscar party crashing
Immortal view of a star doing what Im born to do
I see the blue sky see the Lords coming through

Silhouettes of dreams that we had high huh

Outro Makeba
I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere
I could see it from my window
Wouldnt take that long to get me there
Keep running til I can go
Remember the beautiful things that life could give me
Crazy how Im the one
Couldve been anywhere but Im sitting in the air
With the wheels up staring at the sun
Ohh in the sky well find the light
Ohh until high well shine at night
Now we in the skies blue skies
And we going higher thats right

I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Cinderella fancy but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she trickin off the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake her titties aint fake
Fucking in the car cause we just cant wait
To get home early in the morn getting stoned
Pretty with her eyes low money by her Bible
The type of bitch that BIG said he would die for
Is the type that I ride and stay alive for
Tats on her back looking all tribal
She know shoes like she know survival
Well put together she weathered the storm
Seen her brother die so forever shes strong
Hear Beyonces song and she gotta perform

Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldnt mention
For me getting women turned from sport to addiction
Powerful women playing the roles of submission
Lawyers on leashes congresswomen inflictin
Pain onto my game wanted and Im sadistic
They liked it they dyked it devices twisted

Crib raising kids Labrador behind the white fence
But Im still single looking for Cleopatra
African Queen yo look at me Im a bachelor
Yall niggas in trouble keep your girls behind closed doors
Cross your fingers be happy I havent chose yours
She love glamour bought her Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette my manors
Half hood half class photographers cameras
Caught us out there the spotlight hope she can handle this

Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
Im letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away
Verse  JAYZ
Look I apologize often womanize
Took for my child to be born see through a womans eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song I dont deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
Please come back to Rome you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
   Please pick up the phone pick up the phone   
I said    Dont embarrass me    instead of    Be mine   
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your st birthday
You matured faster than me I wasnt ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for all the stillborns cause I wasnt present
Your body wouldnt accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say Im all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin of all the time you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize
Chorus Hannah Williams
Im never gonna treat you
Im never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh
Verse  JAYZ
I apologize our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay til our backs burn
Were supposed to laugh til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didnt know
I promised I cried I couldnt hold
I suck at love I think I need a doover
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over what if you over my shit
Chorus Hannah Williams
Im never gonna treat you
Im never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh
Verse  JAYZ
And if my children knew
I dont even know what I would do
If they aint look at me the same
I would probly die with all the shame
You did what with who
What good is a m  nage    trois when you have a soulmate
You risked that for Blue
If I wasnt a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blues tooth the tooth fairy didnt pay
Chorus Hannah Williams
Im never gonna treat you like I should

They send me to a level three yard thats where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks just in case the war pops off
Cause you cant tell whats next

And he probably wont make it to see twentytwo

Verse 
Lodi Dodi we likes to party
We dont cause trouble we dont bother nobody
Were just some niggas whore on the mic
And when we rock up on the mic we rock the mic right
For all my doggs keepin yall in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Cause its cool when you cause the cozy conditioning
Which we create cause thats our mission
So listen close to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around  oclock in the morning
I gave myself a strech up a morning yawn and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said Um mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top dog of them all
There was a ruffle duffle five minutes it lasted
The mirror said You are you conceited bastard
Well thats true Thats why we never have no beef
So I slipped on my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file for my fingernails
Im true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnsons Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now Im fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks with my allblue Chucks
Stepped out the house stopped short oh no
I went back in I forgot my Indo
Then I dilly dally I ran through an alley
I bumped into this smoker named Sally from the Valley
This was a girl playing hardtoget
So I said Whats wrong cause she looked upset
She said um
Nancy Flethcer
Its all because of you Im feeling sad and blue
You went away now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so how much youll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me
Verse 
Damn now what was I to do
Shes crying over me and she was feelin blue
I said Um dont cry dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys
Her mean mother steps then says to me Hi
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said What was goin on
I tried to break it up I said Stop it just leave her
She said If I cant smoke none she cant either
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um they gave chase they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbin my dick
And saying
Why dont you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
Ill give you all my love today
Doggy Doggy Doggy cant you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg your love is here to stay
And on and on and on she kept going
The bitch been around before my mother born
I said Cheer up and I gave her a hit
I said You cant have me Im too young for you bitch
She said No youre not then she starts cryin
I says Im  she says Stop lyin
I says I am go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy I cant be your lover

Got a house full of homies why I feel so the opposite

I used to care what people thought but now I care more
I mean nobody out heres got it figured out
So therefore Ive lost all hope of a happy ending

We spend it with no shame we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine or leave it like Cobain
And when Im long gone whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs got a Lambo like LeBrons mom
And no matter where all of my friends go Emily Fam and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk at least I think so cant tell
Cause when them checks clear theyre not here
Cause they dont care its kinda sad but Im laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping Im glad that it happened I mean it
Between us I think theres something special and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand even if you dont understand hold up

Im sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that this songs coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling you start crying
I come over Im inside you
I cant find you the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isnt half bad
The text say that Its not fair
Thats code for Hes not here

Im paranoid that these girls want something from me
And its hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin out over a worse fate
She on time but she late for they first date
Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesomegood problems

Is the only thing girls want when you in that smoke

But I still take my time man I guess Im just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit thats old fashion
Nigga see what Im saying no closed caption
I paint pics see the shit good sex need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth drink a fifth load the nine
Leave you split in the half smoke a half need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got  problems but a bitch aint one
I got  problems getting rich aint one
Like I got trust issues
Im sorry for the people Ive pushed out
Im the type to have a bulletproof condom
And still gotta pull out
But thats just me and I aint perfect
I aint a saint but I am worth it
If its one thing I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it aint working
Lil bitch

Verse 
The other night
Lavish Lee told me that Im all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasnt you you would be dissin you dawg
Damn okay from that perspective
I see what youre talkin bout no way to soften that
Cause me I was tryna find out where I lost em at
But maybe I aint lose em at all
Maybe I keep movin forward and theyre just stagnant
They aint movin at all
But when they need a favor who do they call
Maybe Im searchin for the problems
Askin what was said and who was involved
Too focused on peoples feedback and provin em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit no matter whose foot its on
These days feel like Im squeezin in em
Whoever wore em before just wasnt thinkin big enough
Im bout to leave em with em
Cause if I run in the game in these man the seams are splittin
No pun intended but theyre smellin defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it who meetin me there
They tell him that hes talkin crazy but he doesnt care
Bein humble dont work as well as bein aware
Listen up boy youre better off eavesdroppin
We already got spring  poppin
PND droppin Repsup P droppin
Majid Jordan droppin OB droppin not to mention me droppin
Feel like we paid the refs off man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah been on the move like the lease is up
And I cant even name one person thats keepin up
Damn fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself how do we match up now
Cause Im only  and Im only gettin better
If I havent passed you yet watch me catch up now for real

You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians
Fuck yall know about true competition
Thats like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin
The only one whos hitting are the ones thats currently spittin
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world thats equal for women with no division
Boy I tell you thats vision
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten

Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
Who can come back years later still hit the shot
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block

Sleep if you want NyQuil will help you get your Zs troop

Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from

Change your little drawers cause your pants were saggin
Try to step to this I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Chickity Choco the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel buttcheeks they were kicking

Verse  Phife Dawg
Now heres a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother tell your father send a telegram
Im like an energizer cause you see I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack thats where youre dead wrong
I slayed that buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
Youd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MCs
Cause I love it when you wack MCs despise me
They get vexed I roll next cant none contest me
Im just a fly MC whos five foot three and very brave
On top remaining no home training cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see my auras positive I dont promote no junk
See Im far from a bully and I aint a punk

Verse  QTip
Okay if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed Im agile plus Im worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect Umm
Well its kind of simple just remain your own
Or youll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number fourthousandandeighty
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back cause I think they smoke crack
I dont doubt it look at how they act
Well off to better things like a hiphop forum
Pass me the rock and Ill score em with decorum

Rap is not pop if you call it that then stop

Yo microphone check one two what is this
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause Ill always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still dont know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your {ass}
I never half step cause Im not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name aint Special Ed
So wont you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking its all about me
Even though deep in my heart it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black youre buggin out
Verse  QTip
Zulu Nation brothers last creation
Minds get flooded ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across so bust the floss
As I go in between the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work umm
As I crack the monotone
Children of the jazz so get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they cant do rap
For its Abstract original
You cant get your own and thats pitiful
I know Id be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B but I cant and thats bugged

Verse  Phife Dawg
Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding always surrounding
Pulsing just like a migraine pounding
You dont really fret you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling of absolute tense
You soar off to another world deep in your mind
But people seem to take that as being unkind
Oh yo hes acting stank really on a regal
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nikes
If a crowd is in my realm Im saying  mic please
Hiphop is living cant yank the plug
If you do the result will end up kind of bugged
Verse  QTip
Yo I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road see I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
Im the type of brother with the crazy extended hand kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause youre feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
Its your brain against my mind for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out

Before this did you really know what live was
Comprehend to the track for its why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun thats what I love
A lower plateau is what were above

Verse  QTip Phife Dawg Jarobi QTip & Phife Dawg & QTip & Jarobi
Handle rocks with the capital G ball on the beat
Status Chris Paul and John Wall in the league
Grabbin mics till the knuckles would bleed
Cause I believe
The potent that Im quoting will have you geeked like speed
If rationale is naturale or a weave
Its all edges and peas
Settin press we on a permanent steeze
Im in a world where my princess is Leia
And shes feeling my Vader
And my lure grows greater and greater
Chem trails droppin poisonous vapors
Have you shaking like Gator
Been trill nigga process the data
Bluray wave file or a Beta Ill DVR it for later
Kappo Masa with a G to my waiter
You cant define us XY us or Z us
You generational elitists
Have your chi in virtual think pieces
See these written words are poetical science
Brains defiant thoughts heavy baby
Theyre a major applianceLeave a dent when drop with the flyness fluent giant
Dudes nice he tight screwed in with some pliers
Cool with some buyers
Yeah nigga cool with some growers
Never no tattletales only I dont knowers
We a show me generation show us what you gon show us
So listen mami see we could collude with a boing
Mouthpiece like Goines with a jubilant noise
Dudes rude and as useless as coins shoot em boys
Versed in rehearsed in the soothing of loins

They are extensions of instinctual soulIts the highest in commodity grade

Pass shit been waiting for a Jets title since last

Magic Mike on the mic David Blaine Douglass Henning
In the church of Busta Rhymes its my sermon youre getting
Horizontal spittin Im the exorcist of your writtens
Dont interrupt me nigga sorry thats a sin unforgivenLike how we be skipping on beats like cooking crack in the kitchen
Bbbbbbbut wait
Just spit the package dry it bag up the wet
This mad citys not a game easy quiet on set Phife

People give your ears so I be sublime
Its enjoyable to know you and your concubines
Niggas take off your coats ladies act like gems
Sit down Indian style as we recite these hymns
See lyrically Im Mario Andretti on the MOMO

In my neverending quest to get the paper on the caper
But now let me take it to the Queens side
Im taking it to Brooklyn side

Hold up a second son cause we almost there
You can be a black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove but dont crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self see theres no one else

So do that do that do do that that that come on

Verse  Butterfly
We like the breeze flow straight out of our lids
Then they got moved by these hardrock Brooklyn kids
Us floor rush when the DJs booming classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hiphop records
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthoughtof dimensions
Whys it so fly cause hiphop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light bluesuede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin chunky rhythms right down ya block
We be to rap what key be to lock
But
Im cool like dat

Verse  Butterfly
Boogie jive and rap is life where Im from
Where Im from Ahmed play with Izzy where Im from
Where Im from it be like run your coat black
Jupiter keeps her fat beats by the pack
Where Im from nappy hair is life
We be reading Marx where Im from
The kids be rocking Clarks where Im from
You turn around your cap you talk over a beat
And dig some sounds booming out a jeep
Where Im from cocoons hide the youth swoon units hundred proof
You want some beef they will cut you some where Im from
The beats is infinite where Im from
Voodoo ashubani gangsta lean where Im from
Im interplanetary my insect movements vary
Its kinky if its hair G where Im from
The fire hoses blow
Its purple when it snow
I do a hit and go split
Its hip whats hip
When hip is just the norm
Cause Planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all its forms
The kinks the dance the prints in all the shirts
My grandmother told my Mama that its Africa at work
On vibes we freak them universal beats
You find it at the spot you hit at ends of every week
We twist exist to spin the maddest hits
Up here funk is our neighbour so we paid her a visit
The lip we sip cant house the nine zips
For rock we cant do nothing for this we come equipped
Off disc off tape rap blasting til from eight
The really truly fat the fly on the flip
Cocoa gotta know how Planets gotta roll
Speak the mega cool get funky as a goal
Its calm relax were only some new jacks
That acts from the funk but dont play the role
Where you from
Verse  Doodlebug
Weekend Dig Plans got Ts where Im from
Where Im from its Clarence  where Im from
Where Im from brothers took the beats and got fly
Why Thats most asked by  where Im from
Faking the funk you get did
Projects tenements pyramids where Im from
We living off the boom boom crack
Its that hiphop rockers jazz when I max
Peace be the greeting of the insect tribe
Pestilent forces cant catch the vibe
We live to love and we love to rock mics
We speak in ghetto tongue cause ghettos the life
Food for thought so get a buffet plate
The lyrics are so fat you might gain weight
So just watch me step alone into the sunset
Left foot right foot  mic check
Brewing funk inside my soul kitchen
So pull up a chair heres a bib have a listen
Of hardhead intervene damn I know youre fluent
Yeah cause Doodle aint having it and Butterfly knew it
Where you from
Verse  Ladybug
Venus acts a fool at the square right yeah
Doctors engineer in a pair right yeah
Hiphop made a point last year right yeah
But Planets is the joint this year right yeah
Planets got the dubs and live to grasshop
Duck out from the fuzz that sweat the hiphop
Rising like we foam get it from the dome
Im from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
We can get a kit without no thread
Feeling funky beats go straight to the head
Fall into a club dig on what we love
It be past six before we reach bed
Butter freaks on relics we say those are fat
Doodle Mecc and Silk the quad where its at
We need to stack a sack for rap to take us dap
So we treat our clips just like busting caps
Rip it till dawn kick it till dawn
HipHop is the fix or else we be gone
People thought they canned it
Rap is not by bandits
Digable Planets got it going on

I was raised in the ways of the Manchu Clan
And five elements posture take a Bboy stance
With the gold front shining baggy pants sagging
This Brooklyn styling got the fly girls smiling
But Im climbing finding new ways of rhyming
Not living like a star its strictly bout surviving
Diving deep into the grooves of the ghetto
This downtown flavor shines from many angles
Yes the notorious with rhymes so glorious
The Manchu Monkey over flunkies is victorious
Rappers be boring us with rhymes so conventional
Dazed and amazed when they hear the three dimensional
Lyrical skills of the insect in motion
Coasting down Fulton with a bag of magic potion
Now Im rolling with the seven and the crescents
Puffing some expression
Manifesting todays lessons
Stressing the fact that Im solar guaranteed to go far
Cause the mind is interstellar
Still peace like that so have no fear
But Im slicker this year
Im slicker this year

Verse  Ishmael Butler
Butterfly searching for a relax
Pulling from the jazz stacks cause its Sunday
On the air is incense sounds to the ceiling
Tried to get this feeling since Monday
Looking out the window watching all the people go
Bugging off a funny vibe cause now it seems theyre equal
Wonder what would Trane say wonder what my pop say
Bugging off the calmness in the Apple
Who me Im cooling in New York
Im chilling in New York
The hoods is on my block and the brothers at the court
The baseball hats is on and the projects is calm
Dreamtimes extended and highly recommended
But early birds like mes up checking out the scene
The early worms jog forget about your job
Just come dig the essence while the decadence is hidden
When people act like people the theory is in pigeon
If you know the norm its like Hades transformed
On Sundays early hours the city sprouts its flowers
So get with the rhythms while you getting with the Planets
Vibe off the jams but dont take em for granted just chill
Refrain
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
Verse  Mary Ann Vieira and Craig Irving
We venture through the streets in search of funky beats
Extensive is the travels and its heavy on the sneaks
Ye its kicking out the speakers of the Sunday morning jeepers
My man do Planets do it lovely
Am I my brothers keeper
We foot it to the park where the swoon units walk
And sit with the phoenicians digging on musicians
Hanging with the rebels sipping on a Snapple
Bugging with my crew just tripping in the Apple
You be thinking peace when youre vibing with your flock
But you be thinking damn everybody got a Glock
If you got some beef please express that in silence
Or else violence
But right here is the life its the children of the concrete
Living off the fruits and the functions of the fat beats
Hiphops all around the members is growing
Please dig on the sounds cause the good vibes they snowing so chill
Refrain
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
Verse  Ishmael Butler
Wake up praying that the games on
Maybe its the Running Rebs maybe its the Knicks
Maybe its a rerun of an old TV show
Like Hawaii  or karate flicks
Maybe if the phone rings Butterfly will take wings
Speaking on some cool things fronting like I cope
Born unto flat ground now Im chilling shaky ground
Reaching for Pacific Heights Sunday is my rope dig it
Sundays to relax
Sundays to relax
Some Sunday morning drama is calling up my Mama
The hot line is in I guess the silvers knew the deal
Vibing off the jams of the crews on Sugarhill
Lay around and think aint nothing to do
Checking out some Fromm some Sartre Camus
Mingus Ah Um damn Roach can drum
The DPs are life there they go here they come
Its time to grab some loot put on the Timber boots
Checking out some Dalis like Tasha and Kamali
New York is a museum with its posters and graffiti
If youre in the city on Sunday
Come check me get with me
Refrain
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot

Butterfly
It was  on a beautiful th day of July
There was not a cloud to speak of so the orange sun hung
Lonely in the sky
I lay prone in my catbeat home
Listening to fine nappy Jackie and his jazzcats horn
Sliding in a tape of Bird on Verve when suddenly rang my phone
Hey Butterfly the voice said
Slip on some duds comb out your fro and slide on down to my pad
The vibe here is very pleasant and I truly request your presence
A problem of great magnitude has arose
And as we speak it grows
Damn what could it be I thought
A juice I bought and rolled on down to her spot
Seeing bros I know slapping fives I arrived and pressed G
And there was Nikki
Lookin some kind of sad with tears fallin from her eyes
She sat me down and dug my frown and began to run it down
You remember my boyfriend Sid that fly kid who I love
Well our love was often a verb and spontaneity has brought a third
But due to our youth and economic state we wish to terminate
About this we dont feel great but baby thats how it is
But the feds have dissed me
They ignored and dismissed me
The prolifers harass me outside the clinic
And call me a murderer now thats hate
So needless to say were in a mental state of debate
Hey beautiful bird I said digging her somber mood
The fascists are some heavy dudes
They dont really give a damn about life
They just dont want a woman to control her body
Or have the right to choose
But baby that aint nothin
They just want a male finger on the button
Because if you say war they will send them to die by the score
Aborting mission should be your volition
But if Souter and Thomas have their way
Youll be standing in line unable to get Welfare while theyll be out
Hunting and fishing
It has always been around it will always have a niche
But theyll make it a privilege not a right
Accessible only to the rich
Hey Prolifers need to dig themselves
Because life doesnt stop after birth
And for a child born to the unprepared
It might even just get worse
The situation would surely change if they were to find themselves in it
Supporters of the HBomb and firebombing clinics
What type of shit is that Orwellian in fact
If Roe v Wade was overturned would not the desire remain intact
Leaving young girls to risk their healths
And doctors to botch and watch as they kill themselves
I dont want to sound macabre
But hey isnt it my job
To lay it on the masses and get them off their asses
To fight against these fascists
So whatever you decide make that move with pride
Sid will be there and so will I
An insect til I die
Rhythms and sounds
Spinning around
Confrontations
Across the nation
Your block
My block
Dreadlocks
What a shock
Land of the free
But not me not me
Cop
Alright boy
Butterfly
Ah man
Cop
Give you your rights
Butterfly
Here we go again

You have the right to remain silent

Give up the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you

And my thought to shakin up a few loose
Now I let my cause shoot KRS One
Cause we fade in and out are you swinging or coming

I got Harlem on my mind Darren on my back
Brooklyn in my blood and butters on the track
I got insect thoughts catch the cool ways
Clouds of purple haze keep me in a daze
The jazz the jive the poetry
The style the lingo the bags of equality
Many different things try to get to me
But in a world of hard rock I keep my humility
The funkanaut from the kingdom of not
With galactic sure shot they cant wont dont stop
Flock to the rhythm I bring
Sing songs call survival on the Mingus revival
Scored the bass hit with my bugged out clique
Its Doodlebug give me love for a visual script
Sip the groove juice its kind of rough
Sevens never bluff I had enough eleven

Verse  Butterfly
In the east I rose
Froze in the pose
Of a land diseased
Flows that cooler summer breeze
Nikki did Kevins braids we got four in the Lac
As we swoop at warp seven holler dont crowd cats
Cause look corpie is the color and Butter he do it low
All you hear is poppers and rubber Im saying oh
Man we keep it popping on hot days
Shit I got the fish eggs dropping any block you dip
And I dazzle that mood with the cool out fool
Easing semiswerve to the curb like the do
Im fro blow got that right
Groove with soul and Im still spinnin
Cross  and indicate them something else
Blackest space deepest sea
Scoff My shits a natural high the man cant put no thing on me
Now catch me when my mind stretch out its astro black
Time reaching into end nappy afro blue
We Swing fightin out the corners
Do my thaaang like Huey with it nigga

The ticky ticky buzz the sun wakes the sky
I fumble through my fuzz and buzz Mr I
Tell him scoop the beats in the flying saucer kit
Meet me at the port with the nickel bags and shit
Tell my pops Im out earthbound with the crew
He said Butterfly may the boogie be with you
Left my moms a note with these quotes on a trunk
It says I split to Earth to resurrect the funk
A dozen Snapple pops and a little box of beats
Travelin through space with the funky funky beats
Stopped at Pluto to cop some petrol
Met some Klingons and got our things on
Cruisin warp  with Mr Wiggles in the mix
Hendrix passin peas star child get the fix
The saucer shook the heavens with the blooms and the blams
Because when we hit New York  shazam
We droppin like a comet and this Vulcan tried to Spock it
These martians tried to do it but knew they couldnt cop it
The others from our brother planet lands in the flesh
From up in sector  yes yall
Doodlebug
And its good to be here
When we landed up on lex
Stirrin up the ground with the sound of Doug E Fresh
And the hard rockin kids that did it for the black
With the Pumas on their feet and the bombers on their back
We learned it and we earned it so you know you got to hand it
We planned it when we left how to freak it and to slam it
Add a Ladybug transformation is complete
For the metamorphosis from the box to the Jeep
Ladybug
And its good to be here
Gettin fly with the raps
We love it where we from but we kick it where we at
Bumpin out with somethin that pops and transcends
Dps baby its slim but not thin
In amongst the pebbles we rocks on your blocks
Soakin in the ghetto for kids that have not
Slappin on some skin when we slam check the cheers
So we greet their virgin ears with a kiss
Its so good to be here
All
We jazz up the streets to prove we have beats
Fat jazz fat style and the sound so sweet
And there aint no doubt that you got to check
Doodle Silk Butter Mecc
Its so good to be here
Butterfly
Yeah baby thats the style
The jazz can fill a club or papers by the pile
Just ask toy soldier toy soldier could of told you
At the boomin funk hut it was the Afro with the butt
So to the flam lovers that crowd in dark spots
So see em kick the lingo and grip that little crotch
Now we have arrived with crazy boogie sounds
Get yourself a mate todays to boogie down
This is all we know we feel it when we slams
You could hear the love it comes out in our jams
The hiphop diggin cats just deliverin the words
From the ghettodwellin youth to the bourgies in the burbs
And its good to be here
Butterfly
DPS forever hit ya with the live stuff
Suliman the Bronx Ripper on the live puff

The noise that we made is blue in color sound
Toys who played my crew couldnt walk the new ground
Or chalk the new sound
A bop like Teddy Charles was burning
When I excurse on excursions
Arriving at the doors of mind shores of seas
Burnt you with degrees solarly
Plus my leather jacket go acid disappear in the wisp
In the mist with a fist
Proletariat Cadilac steering it
Fro soul gold Panther crew grab our poppers
Now Im making bacon
Still saying wa ah salaam ah lakum
Fresh joints we make em like water
Butter rap treasures at my leisure whatever whatever
So I gave my mind a pound cause yall we had it down
We symbolize the blessed and represent the rest
Grabs in my pockets I release my hot rockets
KB said What you give em I was like Mad rhythm

The pizza with the pop the west th stop
The crew after crew that do the grasshop

Pop shock picks it up and drops its
We the synthesis of then and now melts
Channeled to the masses through a DJ and some felts
Long haired hippies Afro blacks
All get together across the tracks
Because when we shows up rhythm rolls up
Funk cannot be measured while the pleasure grows up
Life aint what it seems life is but a dream
Planets wreaking havoc is as constant as the rain
Yeah
Sample

But these kids these days they get so high
Burn trees smoke chlorophyll til they cant feel shit
Shitfaced faced it  hits on this L
Elevated train and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill miseducated my dick delegated

Verse  Twista
I could make a flow pitter patter with a patter pitter  juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
Thats the new principle sometimes Imma be about some hoes
Sometimes Imma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast Im the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
Cause Im addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me Im the ObiWan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like Im offa codeine low key
Dont be so judgmental even though Im reminiscing
If I dont know what I miss is
Ima end up figuring out that its home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and Im thanking
I need em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug and I cant cause Im stanking
Never too old for a spanking IGH

I dont make songs for free I make em for freedom
Dont believe in kings believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something bout blonde hair

Said you the man of the house now look out for your family
He has ordered my steps  gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath

They booked the nicest hotels on the th floor
With the big wide windows with the suicide doors
Aint no blood on my money aint no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isnt close aint no visitin Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
Im at war with my wrongs Im writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited Im a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
Im feeling shortness of breath so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water ugh
Good God

Verse  Chance The Rapper
I got my city doing front flips
When every father mayor rapper jump ship
I guess thats why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets so my daughter can have somewhere to play
Im the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I aint goin to hell or to Hillman
Igh Igh Igh Igh for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Cant stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous you dont know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man I dont even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Dosido
Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heavens gates

Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gon make me take the campers way downtown
You gon make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring I dont have to soul search

Verse
Kicked off my shoes tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatchless necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah I inhaled who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young just turned older than him
I seen it happen I seen it happen I see it always
He still be screaming I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And Im hungry Im just not that thirsty
As of late all my verses seem not so versey
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back like Thats not your jersey
Stressin pullin my hair out hoping I dont get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I dont get sick
Making all of this money hoping I dont get rich
Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth dont rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls is that appealing to you
From your cubicle desktop what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Couldve threw him an alleyoop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vics still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that antiviolence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And Im only getting greedier
And Im still Mr Youmedia
And I still cant find Talent
And Im still choosing classmates that wouldnt fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks Im good enough
And Mama Jan still dont take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

I am a new man I am sanctified
Oh I am holy I have been baptized

Verse  Chance The Rapper
We used to roll at the Rink we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much you used to know everything
You couldnt stand me I couldnt stand you
You said Im steady playin but you steady playin too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place
But in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me too worried bout Frooties and Chews
Til I found out all the shawdys with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do

Verse  Chance The Rapper
We never rolled at the Rink
We would just go to the Rink
You aint buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga I couldnt stand him
But when they play Take You Down Chris Brown
I am his standin
I mean its just dancing
Its harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips
And your legs and my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating

Weve got so much history baby maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe Im crazy
Crazy about you

Tossin em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says Catch up nigga it looks like an accident
Um flowing like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like shes been mimicking a panda
Its the dark skinned nigga kissing bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fucking Logic contradicting dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshing in a tar pit
Semenscented cheetah printed tee
In that Preme five panel Ill repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normalass past like I cheated on my team
Its me Tried to get that nigga but Golf Wang
See he did come back though
Verse  Hodgy Beats
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin you own your opponent is a defeatin bonus
Im Zeus to a Kronos cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin
Im on my Robin Hood shit robbing in the hood
Whips drugs jewels and your pet Im stealin your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette soldiers lace the fuckin boot
And salute like the troop when they shoot you gon brrrooop

Nigga Im tryna smoke bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame Talking bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you dont salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia bitch dont get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up throw em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl yo I dont really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus
Verse  Mike G
What the fuck is caution
Often I leave em flossing in KAWS exes next to coffins
Lost in translation the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
Thats great Im home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees huh
Im getting blazed thinking bout those days
I had the top off the GT like toupees
One finger in the air alls fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you dont even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham rock LA to Harlem
If you say Get em Mike G then I got em
One man squadron nigga Im a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or its gonna be real
OF til I OD and I probably will uh
Verse  Domo Genesis
Its still Mr SmokeaLottaPot get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop do I love her Probably not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin drop
Bitch Im in the zone stand alone like Macaulay Cock
Ive been runnin blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now Im all grown same song just a different waltz
Fire what I talk but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit your mistress on my hit list
And Im lifted til Im stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your motherfuckin area
Blood clots give me five feet fore I bury ya
Suicide flow let the big wave carry ya

Drive around with your friends smoke a gram of that haze
Bro easy on the ounce thats a lot for a day
But just enough for a week my nigga what can I say

Imma get you this wine the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time Morris and Day
Course you know the vibes just as fly as the rhymes
On the song cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone

Bumping oldies off my cellular phone

Hey its Jasper not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show so I guess Im an actor
Pot head halfbaked lookin like Chappelle
Rollin up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang nigga so I still dont give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat

Hah nigga came through with a bar real quick
Just for the bitches little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it Wolf Gang

Verse  Earl Sweatshirt
Look for contrast heres a pair of lips
Swallowin sarapin and settin fire to sheriffs whips
Whoops whoops Fuckin AllAmerican terrorist
Crushin rapper larynx to feed em a fuckin carrot stick
And me I just spent a year Ferrisin
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit til the lips meet the bottom of a barrel so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow tight line might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit grimey get dinero type
Feral fuckin illapparelwearin pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin fridges tippin over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And sixtyday chips from fuckin awesome anonymous
Call him bloated til he show em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin hot as dunkin scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada drivin drunk inside a stolen truck
And shittin like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova Im rollin over the novices
And roamin through the forest and spittin cold as his porridge is
Stay gold til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again lord of lips
Bored of this forklift the tippy top best under  list
Stormin the gate ensurin the bass
Scorchin leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me we savages half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who dont give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact your swagger is tacky
So see me you cant like Crunchy Black catchin a taxi
Uh back like lateral passin
With that motherfuckin gladiator manner of rappin
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi please
Verse  Tyler the Creator
OF shit thats all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin down Fax Wolf Gang run the fuckin block
Storefront knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape and my shoes
Um I was fifteen when I first drew that donut
Five years later for our label yeah we own it
I started an empire I aint even old enough
To drink a fucking beer Im tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggas in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the nword
And the ones that got called weird fag bitch nerd
Cause you was into jazz kitty cats and Steven Spielberg
They say we aint actin right
Always try to turn our fuckin color into black and white
But theyll never change em never understand em
Radicals my anthem turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin bein mad as fuck
Just admit not only are we talented were rad as fuck bitches

Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Red light green light red light green light
Red light green light they like
We like fast cars fast money fast life fast broads
Egotistic goin ballistic why God
Born warrior lookin for euphoria
But I dont see it I dont feel it Im paraplegic
Tapped in when Im maxed in CompTown with the MAC s
And the pumps in the background I was absent
Never OG standout I was lackin
Everything else but doubt in the Magnum
Holdin Magnums with a Magnum
Nigga adlib and I sing out loud
Never had friends never had ends never had hope
They was like Nope I was like Boo yaow boo yaow
Yeah God
Tee off the day know we off the be off the eat off your plate
Throw me off I be Off ya head
Well ate on C Im way off the edge
Fuck integrity fuck your pedigree fuck your feelings fuck your culture
Fuck your moral fuck your family fuck your tribe
Fuck your land fuck your children fuck your wives
Who am I Not your father not your brother
Not your reason not your future
Not your comfort not your reverence not your glory
Not your heaven not your angel not your spirit
Not your message not your freedom
Not your people not your neighbor
Not your baby not your equal
Not the title yall want me under
All hail King Killmonger
Red light green light red light green light
Red light green light they like we like

Lawyers and the commissary ain   t gon    pay itself
Where your ass was at when we recorded in the bathroom
Where your ass was at I take attendance like a classroom
Man I ain   t got no choice
Cause nowadays I swear this shit done changed up for the boy
I   m selfmade selfish with my women selfemployed
I   ll buy the neighbors house if they complain about the noise

Where your ass was at last winter was the coldest
Fuck where you was at I had the  on my shoulders

The reason I   m here today cause I aint never gave up

Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Brace yourself Ill take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how Im slingin crack or move cocaine
This is culdesac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant but the stress that weighin on your brain
It was me L Boog and Yan Yan YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly wavin yo hand out the window     check yourself
Uh Warriors and Conans hope euphoria can slow dance
With society the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a lightskinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin that he did it
But ever since that day I was lookin at him different
That was back when I was nine Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door fuck is up
Fuck you shootin for if you aint walkin up you fuckin punk
Pickin up the fuckin pump pickin off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin from AKs ARs Aye yall   duck
Thats what Momma said when we was eatin that free lunch
Aw man goddamn all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in  fuck yo truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Aint no peace treaty just piecin BGs up to preapprove
Bodies on top of bodies IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley make sure your colors correct
Make sure youre corporate or theyll be callin your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes except
When we in traffic and tragic happens that shit aint no threat
You movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial I guess

Wake yo punkass up
It aint nothin but a Compton thang
Gyeah real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
Smoke somethin nigga
Hood Sup Cuz
It aint nothin but a Compton thang
Gyeah how we do
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin in the living room of my mommas pad
Reality struck I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin
In fact I got fired cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin at the mouth
I was straight tweakin the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin
You know the reasons but still will never know my life
Kendrick aka Comptons Human Sacrifice
Interlude MC Eiht
Gyeah cocaine weed
Niggas been mixin shit since the s loc
Sherm sticks buttnakeds

Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One times crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra Rosecrans Bullis its Compton
Verse  MC Eiht
Im still in the hood loc yeah thats cool
Shit the hood took me under so I follow the rules
But yeah thats like me I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin the same thang
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drivebys in the hood lately shit
Couple of IVs with the fuckin spraycan
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew Im finna slay the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy hearts turn brave
Mount up regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip yeah
Trip we in the hood still
So loc grab a strap cause yeah its so real yeah
Deal with the outcome a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grands where a mothafucka stand
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen would you believe me
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat
If I mentioned all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief
And its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the culdesac hostage
Kill em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn they vandalizin the option
Of livin a lie drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin and drive
Hit the powder then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen coward the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit a price on his head the tithes
Probably go to the projects I
Live inside the belly of the rough Compton USA
Made Me an Angel on Angel Dust what
*Scratches*

Aw man    where is she takin me

Verse 
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar
If it do then youre like me
Makin excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release
Everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin why you laugh
Dont you feel bad I probably sleep
And never ever wake up
Never ever wake up never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough
Skit/Outro

Verse  Kendrick Lamar

Loyalty got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power poison pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this since one like this immaculate conception
I transform like this perform like this was Yeshua new weapon
I dont contemplate I meditate then off your fucking head
This that putthekidstobed
This that I got I got I got I got   
Realness I just kill shit    cause its in my DNA
I got millions I got riches buildin in my DNA
I got dark I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again then win again like Wimbledon I serve
Yeah that   s him again the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work I know just who you are
See yous a yous a yous a   
Bitch your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is all that sucker shit inside your DNA

I know murder conviction
Burners boosters burglars ballers dead redemption
Scholars fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah yeah yeah yeah soldier   s DNA soldier   s DNA
Born inside the beast my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was  on cell motel we didnt have nowhere to stay
At  I   ve done so well hit cartwheel in my estate
And Im gon shine like Im supposed to antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And that   s a riff gon plead his case
The reason my powers here on earth
Salute the truth when the prophet say
Bridge Kendrick Lamar & Geraldo Rivera
I got loyalty got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I got loyalty got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life Im rollin several dice fuck your life
I got loyalty got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be fuck your life
    
This is my heritage all Im inheritin
Money and power the maker of marriages
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Tell me somethin
You mothafuckas cant tell me nothin
Id rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin bullets reapin what you sow
And stackin up the footage livin on the go
And sleepin in a villa
Sippin from a Grammy and walkin in the buildin
Diamond in the ceilin marble on the floors
Beach inside the window peekin out the window
Baby in the pool godfather goals
Only Lord knows Ive been goin hammer
Dodgin paparazzi freakin through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters Brock wearin sandals
Yoga on a Monday stretchin to Nirvana
Watchin all the snakes curvin all the fakes
Phone never on I dont conversate
I dont compromise I just penetrate
Sex money murder   these are the breaks
These are the times level number 
Look up in the sky  is on the way
Sentence on the way killings on the way
Motherfucker I got winners on the way
You aint shit without a body on your belt
You aint shit without a ticket on your plate
You aint sick enough to pull it on yourself
You aint rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate gonna be our faith
Peace to the world let it rotate
Sex money murder   our DNA

Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Me and my niggas tryna get it ya bish
Hit the house lick tell me is you wit it ya bish
Home invasion was persuasive
From nine to five I know its vacant ya bish
Dreams of livin life like rappers do
Back when condom wrappers wasnt cool
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros
Then Usher Raymond Let It Burn came on
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen ya bish
Park the car then we start rhymin ya bish
The only thing we had to free our mind
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs
You lookin like a easy comeup ya bish
A silver spoon I know you come from ya bish
And thats a lifestyle that we never knew
Go at a reverend for the revenue

Pick your poison tell me what you doin
Everybody gon respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever

And I been hustlin all day
Thisaway thataway
Through canals and alleyways just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And thats just how I feel nah nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
Thats just how I feel nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
Thats just how I feel nah nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
Thats just how I feel nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
Thats just how I feel
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
Dreams of livin life like rappers do
Bump that new E after school
You know    Big Ballin With My Homies   
Earl Stevens had us thinkin rational
Back to reality we poor ya bish
Another casualty at war ya bish
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head
He said one day Ill be on tour ya bish
That Louis Burger never be the same
A Louis belt will never ease that pain
But Ima purchase when that day is jerkin
Pull off at Churchs with Pirellis skirtin
Gang signs out the window ya bish
Hopin all of em offend you ya bish
They say your hood is a pot of gold
And we gon crash it when nobodys home

Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus dont miss them stockings
Liquors spillin pistols poppin
Bakin soda YOLA whippin
Aint no turkey on Thanksgivin
My homeboy just domed a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day Im hustlin
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter nem
Get the fuck up out my way bish
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade bish
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys dont see my stash
If they do tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass aint cut
Them serpents lurkin Blood
Bitches sellin pussy niggas sellin drugs
But its all good
Broken promises steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your Js and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin shaded under a money tree

Look inside of my soul
And you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes
I can feel a new life I always knew life can be dangerous
I can say that I like a challenge and you tell me its painless
You dont know what pain is
How can I paint this picture
When the color blind is hangin with you
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar
Another mistake livin deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick
I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every making of this
Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge
Even a small lighter can burn a bridge

You live in a world you livin behind the mirror

The feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital I know you had to

To die in a pitiful vain tell me a watch and a chain

Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds

Talkin out his head philosophin on what the Lord had done
He said KDot can you pray for me
It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed show me how to overcome
He was lookin for some closure
Hopin I could bring him closer
To the spiritual my spirit do know better but I told him
I cant sugarcoat the answer for you this is how I feel
If somebody kill my son that mean somebody gettin killed
Tell me what you do for love loyalty and passion of
All the memories collected moments you could never touch
Ill wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
Ill catch a nigga leavin service if thats all I got
Ill chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like Bitch I did that
Aint no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I cant even keep the peace dont you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister touch my woman
Touch my daddy touch my niece
Touch my nephew touch my brother
You should chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap

Hail Mary Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders
Look what you taught us
Its murder on my street your street back streets
Wall Street corporate offices
Banks employees and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts Donald Trumps in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin
Pass the gin I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in you Crippin or you married to Blood
Ill ask again     oops accident
Its nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists et cetera et cetera
Americas reflections of me thats what a mirror does

Hands up high hands up high
Tell em dim the lights down right now
Put me in the mood
Im talkin about dark room perfume go go
Verse  Kendrick Lamar
I recognize your fragrance
Hold up you aint never gotta say shit
Uh and I know your taste is
A little bit hmm high maintenance
Uh everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
Youre in the mood for empathy theres blood in my pen
Better yet where your friends and em
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends
And yall curled in that little bitty Range
I heard that she wanna go and party she wanna go and party
Nigga dont approach her with that Atari
Nigga that aint good game homie sorry
They say conversation rule a nation I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs
Less I write it down for real PS

I really hope you play this cause ol girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs
And all these oneoff vacations youve been takin
Clearly a lot for me to take in it dont make sense
Young East African girl you too busy fuckin with your other man
I was tryna put you on game put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it maybe one day
When you figure out youre gonna need someone
When you figure out its alright here in the city
And you dont run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice poetic justice
You were so new to this life but goddamn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin
And your big ass in that sundress ooh
Good God what you doin that walk for
When I see that thing move
I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs
Unless I write em down for real PS

Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin sure my punctuation curve every letter heres true
Livin my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
Im talkin poetic justice poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it I mean you need to hear this
Love is not just a verb its you lookin in the mirror
Love is not just a verb its you lookin for it maybe
Call me crazy we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common and what we have common is pain
I mean you need to hear this love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference its coherent I can hear it
Uhhuh thats your heartbeat
It either caught me or it called me uhhuh
Read slow and youll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely yours truly and right before you go blind PS

There are times
When youll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Verse 
I never knew a luh luhluh a love like this
Gotta be somethin for me to write this
Queen I aint seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit lets spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I aint gon assault them    cause I probably did it too
Because of you feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light
But they cant handle the glare
You know I aint the type to walk around with matchin shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest
And hurt you the most
They say the end is near its important that we close
To the most high
Regardless of what happen on Him lets rely
Hook
There are times
When youll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
Verse 
Its important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
Theres so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But thats fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi nights moon you my light
If Heaven had a height you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop through you I see that all

Granted we known each other for some time

Its kind of fresh you listen to more than hiphop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when its time to
Thinkin you fresh suggestin beats I should rhyme to
At times when Im lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when its time to
My hearts dictionary defines you its love and happiness
Truthfully its hard tryin to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex aint gon keep you
But as my equal its how I must treat you
As my reflection in light Ima lead you
And whatevers right Ima feed you

Verse 
I met this girl when I was  years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money those studs was miccheckin her
But I respected her she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her turn on the air for her
And just cool out cool out and listen to her
Sittin on a bone wishin that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be then it would be
   Cause we related physically and mentally
And she was fun then Id be geeked when shed come around
Slim was fresh joe when she was underground
Original pure untampered a down sister
Boy I tell you I miss her

Verse 
Now periodically I would see
Ol girl at the clubs and at the house parties
She didnt have a body but she started gettin thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin the violence
About my people she was teachin me
By not preachin to me but speakin to me
In a method that was leisurely so easily I approach
She dug my rap thats how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast and that was cool
Cause around the same time I went away to school
And Im a man of expandin so why should I stand in her way
She probably get her money in LA
And she did stud she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the problack was goin out of style
She said Afrocentricity was of the past
So she got into R&B hiphouse bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and its all good
I wasnt salty she was with the boys in the hood
Cause that was good for her she was becomin wellrounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin fun not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung

Verse 
I mightve failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials shes universal
She used to only swing it with the innercity circle
Now she be in the burbs lookin rock and dressin hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin bout poppin Glocks servin rocks and hittin switches
Now shes a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches
Always smokin blunts and gettin drunk
Tellin me sad stories now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest before she got into showbiz
I did her not just to say that I did it
But Im committed girl hes committed but so many niggas hit it
That shes just not the same lettin all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin her and takin her to the sewer
But Ima take her back hopin that the shit stop
   Cause who Im talkin about yall is hiphop

Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
They marched with the torch we gon run with it now
Never look back we done gone hundreds of miles
From dark roads he rose to become a hero
Facin the league of justice his power was the people
Enemy is lethal a king became regal
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle
The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
We sing our music is the cuts that we bleed through
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history
No one can win the war individually
It takes the wisdom of the elders and young peoples energy
Welcome to the story we call victory
The comin of the Lord my eyes have seen the glory

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Its a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me
Verse 
Yeah you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldnt sleep cause on the real he had five kids
Live nigs real niggas express and taste it
At crap games black dames and big faces
Cases in court fam showing love and support
You and your babys mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
Thats why we dont know how til were older men
If love is a place Ima go again
At least now now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then youre home again
Ive seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he dont want to end

In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love hoping itd become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Trying to find herself again much of that shed have gave
Love can free us to it some of us react as a slave
Funny we love em more when theyre relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw is he actin afraid
Everybody loves sun why do I attract shade
Heard of the love of money but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so shed understand
What it is to be loved by a man

Intro Justin Timberlake
Youd take the clothes off my back and Id let you
Youd steal the food right out my mouth
And Id watch you eat it
I still don   t know why why our love is so much ohh
Thanks for warnin me thanks for warnin me
You curse my name in spite to put me to shame
Hang my laundry in the streets dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still dont know why why I love it so much
Thanks for warnin me thanks for warnin me
Chorus Justin Timberlake
And baby its amazin Im in this maze with you

One day you screamin you love me loud
The next day youre so cold
One day youre here one day youre there one day you care
Youre so unfair
Sippin from your cup til it runneth over

Verse  Jay Z
Blue told me remind you niggas
Fuck that shit yall talking bout Im the nigga
Caught up in all these lights and cameras
But look what that shit did to Hammer
Goddamn it I like it
Bright lights is enticin but look what it did to Tyson
All that money in one night thirty mil for one fight
But soon as all the money blows all the pigeons take flight
Fuck the fame keep cheatin on me
What I do I took her back
Fool me twice thats my bad I cant even blame her for that
Enough to make me wanna murder
Momma please just get my bail
I know nobody to blame Kurt Cobain I did it to myself

Verse  Jay Z

Who the fuck Im kiddin though

Slidin by in that big body curtains all in my window
This fame hurt but this chain worse
I think back you asked the same person
If this is all you had to deal with
Nigga deal with this shit aint work
This light work camera snappin my eyes hurt
Niggas dying back where I was birthed
Fuck your iris and the IRS

You got the shit that niggas die for dry yours
Why you mad Take the good with the bad
Or throw the baby out with that bath water

Forever in ink with guess whose name

Why do I keep on running away
Verse  JAYZ
Look I apologize often womanize
Took for my child to be born see through a womans eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song I dont deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
Please come back to Rome you make it home
We talked for hours when you were on tour
   Please pick up the phone pick up the phone   
I said    Dont embarrass me    instead of    Be mine   
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your st birthday
You matured faster than me I wasnt ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn this death and
I apologize for all the stillborns cause I wasnt present
Your body wouldnt accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize cause at your best you are love
And because I fall short of what I say Im all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin of all the time you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize
Chorus Hannah Williams
Im never gonna treat you
Im never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh
Verse  JAYZ
I apologize our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay til our backs burn
Were supposed to laugh til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didnt know
I promised I cried I couldnt hold
I suck at love I think I need a doover
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over what if you over my shit
Chorus Hannah Williams
Im never gonna treat you
Im never gonna treat you like I should
Ohhhhhh
Verse  JAYZ
And if my children knew
I dont even know what I would do
If they aint look at me the same
I would probly die with all the shame
You did what with who
What good is a m  nage    trois when you have a soulmate
You risked that for Blue
If I wasnt a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blues tooth the tooth fairy didnt pay

Red jumpsuit with two braids in my hair
Niggas stare as I enter the center
They send me to a level three yard thats where I stay
Late night I hear toothbrushes scraping on the floor
Niggas getting they shanks just in case the war pops off
Cause you cant tell whats next
My little homie Baby Boo took a pencil in his neck
And he probably wont make it to see twentytwo
I put that on my Momma Ima ride for you Baby Boo

For all my doggs keepin yall in health
Just to see you smile and enjoy yourself
Cause its cool when you cause the cozy conditioning
Which we create cause thats our mission
So listen close to what we say
Because this types of shit happens every day
I woke up around  oclock in the morning
I gave myself a strech up a morning yawn and
Went to the bathroom to wash up
I threw some soap on my face and put my hands up on a cup
And said Um mirror mirror on the wall
Who is the top dog of them all
There was a ruffle duffle five minutes it lasted
The mirror said You are you conceited bastard
Well thats true Thats why we never have no beef
So I slipped on my khakis and my gold leaf
Used Oil of Olay cause my skin gets pale
And then I got the file for my fingernails
Im true to the style on my behalf
I put some bubbles in the tub so I can take a bubble bath
Clean dry was my body and hair
I threw on my brand new doggy underwear
For all the bitches I might take home
I got the Johnsons Baby Powder and Cool Water cologne
Now Im fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my white socks with my allblue Chucks
Stepped out the house stopped short oh no
I went back in I forgot my Indo
Then I dilly dally I ran through an alley
I bumped into this smoker named Sally from the Valley
This was a girl playing hardtoget
So I said Whats wrong cause she looked upset
She said um
Nancy Flethcer
Its all because of you Im feeling sad and blue
You went away now my life is filled with rainy days
I love you so how much youll never know
Cause you took your dope away from me
Verse 
Damn now what was I to do
Shes crying over me and she was feelin blue
I said Um dont cry dry your eye
And here comes your mother with those two little guys
Her mean mother steps then says to me Hi
Decked Sally in the face and punched her in the eye
Punched her in the belly and stepped on her feet
Slammed the child on the hard concrete
The bitch was strong the kids was gone
Something was wrong I said What was goin on
I tried to break it up I said Stop it just leave her
She said If I cant smoke none she cant either
She grabbed me closely by my socks
So I broke the hell out and I grabbed my sack of rocks
But um they gave chase they caught up quick
They started crying on my shoes and grabbin my dick
And saying
Why dont you give me a play
So we can break it down the Long Beach way
And if you give me that okay
Ill give you all my love today
Doggy Doggy Doggy cant you see
Somehow your words just hypnotize me
And I just love your jazzy ways
Doggy Dogg your love is here to stay
And on and on and on she kept going
The bitch been around before my mother born
I said Cheer up and I gave her a hit
I said You cant have me Im too young for you bitch
She said No youre not then she starts cryin
I says Im  she says Stop lyin
I says I am go ask my mother
And with your wrinkled pussy I cant be your lover

Hold up wait a minute all good just a week ago

Now the thrill is gone got no patience cause Im not a doctor
Girl why is you lying girl why you Mufasa
Yeah mi casa su casa got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes now the flow is so lava
Yeah we spit that saliva iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra or we let bygones be bygones
My God you pay for your friends Ill take that as a compliment
Got a house full of homies why I feel so the opposite
Incompetent aint the half of it

Verse 
I used to care what people thought but now I care more
I mean nobody out heres got it figured out
So therefore Ive lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not its worth it so insecure no ones perfect
We spend it with no shame we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine or leave it like Cobain
And when Im long gone whole crew sing a swan song
Cause we all just ticking time bombs got a Lambo like LeBrons mom
And no matter where all of my friends go Emily Fam and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk at least I think so cant tell
Cause when them checks clear theyre not here
Cause they dont care its kinda sad but Im laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping Im glad that it happened I mean it
Between us I think theres something special and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand even if you dont understand hold up

You start calling you start crying

But the sex that we have isnt half bad

Thats code for Hes not here

Wonder if youre rolling up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you gettin nasty for someone else

Be a good girl you was in the zone
Yeah you should just be yourself

You gon make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon make me go out of my fuckin way
I waited four days nigga where yall at

But I guess this is what I gotta do to make yall rap

This for yall that think that I dont write enough
They just mad    cause I got the Midas touch
You love her then you gotta give the world to her

I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This aint what she meant when she told you to open up more

The point Im tryin to make is I dont ever need em
Seen what you   d do for fame what would you do for freedom
Please check em for a wire or a earpiece
Please please do not let these niggas near me
Please think before you come for the great one
Please whos a real nigga and who aint one
Please somebody stop me

Ho shut the fuck up
I got way too much on my mental
I learn from what Ive been through
Im finna do what I didnt do
And still waking up like the rents due
Not complicated its simple
I got sexy ladies a whole Benzfull
And to them hoes Im everything   everything but gentle
But I still take my time man I guess Im just old fashioned
Wearing retro shit thats old fashion
Nigga see what Im saying no closed caption
I paint pics see the shit good sex need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year round like season tickets
I plead the fifth drink a fifth load the nine
Leave you split in the half smoke a half need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got  problems but a bitch aint one
I got  problems getting rich aint one
Like I got trust issues
Im sorry for the people Ive pushed out
Im the type to have a bulletproof condom
And still gotta pull out
But thats just me and I aint perfect
I aint a saint but I am worth it
If its one thing I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it aint working

The other night
Lavish Lee told me that Im all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasnt you you would be dissin you dawg
Damn okay from that perspective
I see what youre talkin bout no way to soften that
Cause me I was tryna find out where I lost em at
But maybe I aint lose em at all
Maybe I keep movin forward and theyre just stagnant
They aint movin at all
But when they need a favor who do they call
Maybe Im searchin for the problems
Askin what was said and who was involved
Too focused on peoples feedback and provin em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit no matter whose foot its on
These days feel like Im squeezin in em
Whoever wore em before just wasnt thinkin big enough
Im bout to leave em with em
Cause if I run in the game in these man the seams are splittin
No pun intended but theyre smellin defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it who meetin me there
They tell him that hes talkin crazy but he doesnt care
Bein humble dont work as well as bein aware
Listen up boy youre better off eavesdroppin
We already got spring  poppin
PND droppin Repsup P droppin
Majid Jordan droppin OB droppin not to mention me droppin
Feel like we paid the refs off man we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah been on the move like the lease is up
And I cant even name one person thats keepin up
Damn fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself how do we match up now
Cause Im only  and Im only gettin better
If I havent passed you yet watch me catch up now for real

The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She dont love me she make money she dont study that
She gon give it to me aint gon tell me run it back
She gon take the brain to wetter plains she spit on that
The doors have signs with dont try to rhyme with
VH has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary Id probably do that shit sporadically

Better yet street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians

The only one whos hitting are the ones thats currently spittin
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world thats equal for women with no division
Boy I tell you thats vision

Who can come back years later still hit the shot
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block

This is how I represent over this here beat

But weve been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe so
Sleep if you want NyQuil will help you get your Zs troop
But heres the real scoop
Im all that and then some short dark and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
Im vexed fuming Ive had it up to here

Watch me wreck it from the jump street meaning from the getgo

Lay back on the payback evolve rotate the gates Contact
Can I get a hit Hit Boom bip
With a brother named Tip and were ready to flip
East coast stomping ripping and romping
New York North Cakalaka and Compton
Checkacheckacheck it out
The loops for the troops more bounce to the ounce
And wowhownowwow how now Brown cow

From radio to the video to Arsenio
Tell me yo whats the scenario
Verse  Dinco D
True blue Scooby Doo whoopie doo
Scenarios radios rates more than four
Scores for the smores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine shades of sea shore
Shipshape crushed grapes apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an Lah an eader simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace see ya later
Later Later later alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the herbs the inflater
So yo the D what The O
Incorporated INC into a flow
Funk flipped flat back first this foul fight fight fight
Laugh yo howd that sound Ooh
Verse  QTip
Its a LeaderQuest mission and we got the goods here Here
Never on the left cause my rights my good ear Ear
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime so I aint no criminal
I love my young nation groovy sensation
No time for hibernation only elation
Dont ever try to test the water little kid
Yo Mr Busta Rhymes tell him what I did   
Verse  Busta Rhymes
   I heard you rushed and rushed and attacked
Then they rebuked and you had to smack
Causing rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear   
Verse  QTip
   You know I did it
So dont violate or youll get violated
The hiphop sound is well agitated
Wont ever waste no time on a played out ego
So heres Busta Rhymes with the scenario
Verse  Busta Rhymes
Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up wheel up bring it back come rewind
Powerful impact Boom from the cannon
Not bragging tryna read my mind just imagine
Vocabularys necessary
When diggin into my library
Oh my gosh Oh my gosh
Eating Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh
Unh Unh Unh All over the track man
Unh pardon me unh As I come back
As I did it yo I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town I roll with the squadron
Rawr Rawr Like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers cause your pants were saggin
Try to step to this I will twist you in a turban
And have you smelling ripe like some old stale urine
Chickity Choco the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel buttcheeks they were kicking
Yo bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme

Verse  Phife Dawg
Now heres a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother tell your father send a telegram
Im like an energizer cause you see I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack thats where youre dead wrong
I slayed that buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
Youd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MCs
Cause I love it when you wack MCs despise me
They get vexed I roll next cant none contest me
Im just a fly MC whos five foot three and very brave
On top remaining no home training cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt the jim must be erect
You see my auras positive I dont promote no junk
See Im far from a bully and I aint a punk
Extremity in rhythm yeah thats what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word

Verse  Phife Dawg & QTip
Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin
It was I the Phifer And me the Abstract
The rhymes were so rumpin that the brothers rode the zack

So play the resurrector and give the dead some life
Verse  QTip
Okay if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed Im agile plus Im worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect Umm
Well its kind of simple just remain your own
Or youll be crazy sad and alone
Industry rule number fourthousandandeighty
Record company people are shady
So kids watch your back cause I think they smoke crack
I dont doubt it look at how they act
Well off to better things like a hiphop forum
Pass me the rock and Ill score em with decorum
And proper   what you say Hammer Proper
Rap is not pop if you call it that then stop

Verse  Phife Dawg
Yo microphone check one two what is this
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause Ill always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still dont know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your {ass}
I never half step cause Im not a half stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name aint Special Ed
So wont you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking its all about me
Even though deep in my heart it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black youre buggin out
Verse  QTip
Zulu Nation brothers last creation
Minds get flooded ejaculation
Right on the two inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across so bust the floss
As I go in between the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work umm
As I crack the monotone
Children of the jazz so get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they cant do rap
For its Abstract original
You cant get your own and thats pitiful
I know Id be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B but I cant and thats bugged

Verse  Phife Dawg
Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you do it just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding always surrounding
Pulsing just like a migraine pounding
You dont really fret you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling of absolute tense
You soar off to another world deep in your mind
But people seem to take that as being unkind
Oh yo hes acting stank really on a regal
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nikes
If a crowd is in my realm Im saying  mic please
Hiphop is living cant yank the plug
If you do the result will end up kind of bugged
Verse  QTip
Yo I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road see I was Boulevard status
Battling a MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
Im the type of brother with the crazy extended hand kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause youre feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
Its your brain against my mind for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out

Comprehend to the track for its why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun thats what I love
A lower plateau is what were above

We like the breeze flow straight out of our lids
Then they got moved by these hardrock Brooklyn kids
Us floor rush when the DJs booming classics
You dig the crew on the fattest hiphop records
He touch the kinks and sinks into the sounds
She frequents the fattest joints caught underground
Our funk zooms like you hit the Mary Jane
They flock to booms man boogie had to change
Who freaks the clips with mad amount percussion
Where kinky hair goes to unthoughtof dimensions
Whys it so fly cause hiphop kept some drama
When Butterfly rocked his light bluesuede Pumas
What by the cut we push it off the corner
How was the buzz entire hip hop era
Was fresh and fat since they started saying outtie
Cause funks made fat from right beneath my hoodie
The poobah of the styles like Miles and shit
Like sixties funky worms with waves and perms
Just sendin chunky rhythms right down ya block
We be to rap what key be to lock

Boogie jive and rap is life where Im from
Where Im from Ahmed play with Izzy where Im from
Where Im from it be like run your coat black
Jupiter keeps her fat beats by the pack
Where Im from nappy hair is life
We be reading Marx where Im from
The kids be rocking Clarks where Im from
You turn around your cap you talk over a beat
And dig some sounds booming out a jeep
Where Im from cocoons hide the youth swoon units hundred proof
You want some beef they will cut you some where Im from
The beats is infinite where Im from
Voodoo ashubani gangsta lean where Im from
Im interplanetary my insect movements vary
Its kinky if its hair G where Im from
The fire hoses blow
Its purple when it snow
I do a hit and go split
Its hip whats hip
When hip is just the norm
Cause Planets pledge allegiance to the funk in all its forms
The kinks the dance the prints in all the shirts
My grandmother told my Mama that its Africa at work
On vibes we freak them universal beats
You find it at the spot you hit at ends of every week
We twist exist to spin the maddest hits
Up here funk is our neighbour so we paid her a visit
The lip we sip cant house the nine zips
For rock we cant do nothing for this we come equipped
Off disc off tape rap blasting til from eight
The really truly fat the fly on the flip
Cocoa gotta know how Planets gotta roll
Speak the mega cool get funky as a goal
Its calm relax were only some new jacks
That acts from the funk but dont play the role
Where you from
Verse  Doodlebug
Weekend Dig Plans got Ts where Im from
Where Im from its Clarence  where Im from
Where Im from brothers took the beats and got fly
Why Thats most asked by  where Im from
Faking the funk you get did
Projects tenements pyramids where Im from
We living off the boom boom crack
Its that hiphop rockers jazz when I max
Peace be the greeting of the insect tribe
Pestilent forces cant catch the vibe
We live to love and we love to rock mics
We speak in ghetto tongue cause ghettos the life
Food for thought so get a buffet plate
The lyrics are so fat you might gain weight
So just watch me step alone into the sunset
Left foot right foot  mic check
Brewing funk inside my soul kitchen
So pull up a chair heres a bib have a listen
Of hardhead intervene damn I know youre fluent
Yeah cause Doodle aint having it and Butterfly knew it
Where you from
Verse  Ladybug
Venus acts a fool at the square right yeah
Doctors engineer in a pair right yeah
Hiphop made a point last year right yeah
But Planets is the joint this year right yeah
Planets got the dubs and live to grasshop
Duck out from the fuzz that sweat the hiphop
Rising like we foam get it from the dome
Im from where the fat beats stretch for mad blocks
We can get a kit without no thread
Feeling funky beats go straight to the head
Fall into a club dig on what we love
It be past six before we reach bed
Butter freaks on relics we say those are fat
Doodle Mecc and Silk the quad where its at
We need to stack a sack for rap to take us dap
So we treat our clips just like busting caps
Rip it till dawn kick it till dawn
HipHop is the fix or else we be gone
People thought they canned it
Rap is not by bandits
Digable Planets got it going on

This Brooklyn styling got the fly girls smiling
But Im climbing finding new ways of rhyming
Not living like a star its strictly bout surviving
Diving deep into the grooves of the ghetto
This downtown flavor shines from many angles
Yes the notorious with rhymes so glorious
The Manchu Monkey over flunkies is victorious
Rappers be boring us with rhymes so conventional
Dazed and amazed when they hear the three dimensional
Lyrical skills of the insect in motion
Coasting down Fulton with a bag of magic potion
Now Im rolling with the seven and the crescents
Puffing some expression
Manifesting todays lessons
Stressing the fact that Im solar guaranteed to go far
Cause the mind is interstellar
Still peace like that so have no fear
But Im slicker this year
Im slicker this year
Refrain
To the queens everywhere making money
To the whole SI making money
To the lumpen mass making money
Dont forget about your peeps when ya making money
Ladybug Mecca
Now you see that Im  inches above sea level
 million miles above these devils
Play me in the winter
Play me in the summer
Play me in the autumn
Any order
You want em I got em dripping like water
Catch me at a hot spot with the dusk daughters
We bouncing moving within the true circles
We played you made you change straight New Yorked you
We stratify our wealth from my Luchi in the bank
Theres love amongst the ranks
Now Im about to beep my homegirl
Cause we be alike
Aalike Calike yes Galike
Jazzy Joyce on the wheels
Jazzy Joyce no one smoother
Jazzy Joyce phatter than a  Land Cruiser
Where you from
The Bronx representing like whatever pa
Cool are you slicker this year
Yeah watch
Verse  Ishmael Butler
Butterfly searching for a relax
Pulling from the jazz stacks cause its Sunday
On the air is incense sounds to the ceiling
Tried to get this feeling since Monday
Looking out the window watching all the people go
Bugging off a funny vibe cause now it seems theyre equal
Wonder what would Trane say wonder what my pop say
Bugging off the calmness in the Apple
Who me Im cooling in New York
Im chilling in New York
The hoods is on my block and the brothers at the court
The baseball hats is on and the projects is calm
Dreamtimes extended and highly recommended
But early birds like mes up checking out the scene
The early worms jog forget about your job
Just come dig the essence while the decadence is hidden
When people act like people the theory is in pigeon
If you know the norm its like Hades transformed
On Sundays early hours the city sprouts its flowers
So get with the rhythms while you getting with the Planets
Vibe off the jams but dont take em for granted just chill
Refrain
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
Verse  Mary Ann Vieira and Craig Irving
We venture through the streets in search of funky beats
Extensive is the travels and its heavy on the sneaks
Ye its kicking out the speakers of the Sunday morning jeepers
My man do Planets do it lovely
Am I my brothers keeper
We foot it to the park where the swoon units walk
And sit with the phoenicians digging on musicians
Hanging with the rebels sipping on a Snapple
Bugging with my crew just tripping in the Apple
You be thinking peace when youre vibing with your flock
But you be thinking damn everybody got a Glock
If you got some beef please express that in silence
Or else violence
But right here is the life its the children of the concrete
Living off the fruits and the functions of the fat beats
Hiphops all around the members is growing
Please dig on the sounds cause the good vibes they snowing so chill
Refrain
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
Verse  Ishmael Butler
Wake up praying that the games on
Maybe its the Running Rebs maybe its the Knicks
Maybe its a rerun of an old TV show
Like Hawaii  or karate flicks
Maybe if the phone rings Butterfly will take wings
Speaking on some cool things fronting like I cope
Born unto flat ground now Im chilling shaky ground
Reaching for Pacific Heights Sunday is my rope dig it
Sundays to relax
Sundays to relax
Some Sunday morning drama is calling up my Mama
The hot line is in I guess the silvers knew the deal
Vibing off the jams of the crews on Sugarhill
Lay around and think aint nothing to do
Checking out some Fromm some Sartre Camus
Mingus Ah Um damn Roach can drum
The DPs are life there they go here they come
Its time to grab some loot put on the Timber boots
Checking out some Dalis like Tasha and Kamali
New York is a museum with its posters and graffiti
If youre in the city on Sunday
Come check me get with me
Refrain
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
New York is red hot New York is red hot
Butterfly
It was  on a beautiful th day of July
There was not a cloud to speak of so the orange sun hung
Lonely in the sky
I lay prone in my catbeat home
Listening to fine nappy Jackie and his jazzcats horn
Sliding in a tape of Bird on Verve when suddenly rang my phone
Hey Butterfly the voice said
Slip on some duds comb out your fro and slide on down to my pad
The vibe here is very pleasant and I truly request your presence
A problem of great magnitude has arose
And as we speak it grows
Damn what could it be I thought
A juice I bought and rolled on down to her spot
Seeing bros I know slapping fives I arrived and pressed G
And there was Nikki
Lookin some kind of sad with tears fallin from her eyes
She sat me down and dug my frown and began to run it down
You remember my boyfriend Sid that fly kid who I love
Well our love was often a verb and spontaneity has brought a third
But due to our youth and economic state we wish to terminate
About this we dont feel great but baby thats how it is
But the feds have dissed me
They ignored and dismissed me
The prolifers harass me outside the clinic
And call me a murderer now thats hate
So needless to say were in a mental state of debate
Hey beautiful bird I said digging her somber mood
The fascists are some heavy dudes
They dont really give a damn about life
They just dont want a woman to control her body
Or have the right to choose
But baby that aint nothin
They just want a male finger on the button
Because if you say war they will send them to die by the score
Aborting mission should be your volition
But if Souter and Thomas have their way
Youll be standing in line unable to get Welfare while theyll be out
Hunting and fishing
It has always been around it will always have a niche
But theyll make it a privilege not a right
Accessible only to the rich
Hey Prolifers need to dig themselves
Because life doesnt stop after birth
And for a child born to the unprepared
It might even just get worse
The situation would surely change if they were to find themselves in it
Supporters of the HBomb and firebombing clinics
What type of shit is that Orwellian in fact
If Roe v Wade was overturned would not the desire remain intact
Leaving young girls to risk their healths
And doctors to botch and watch as they kill themselves
I dont want to sound macabre
But hey isnt it my job
To lay it on the masses and get them off their asses
To fight against these fascists
So whatever you decide make that move with pride
Sid will be there and so will I
An insect til I die
Rhythms and sounds
Spinning around
Confrontations
Across the nation
Your block
My block
Dreadlocks
What a shock
Land of the free
But not me not me
Cop
Alright boy
Butterfly
Ah man
Cop
Give you your rights
Butterfly
Here we go again
Cop
You have the right to remain silent
Ladybug
Hey Ish whats goin on
Butterfly
Chill chill its cool
Cop
Give up the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you
Butterfly
Whatever man whatever
Cop
Do you understand each of these rights Ive explained to you
Butterfly
Oh like I ever had rights kid
Cop
Do you wish to give up the right to remain silent
Butterfly
Hell yeah
Verse  Ladybug Mecca
So now lets let into in my pocket pack
Pummel and I epic black ethic lack
I walk again you were shade gray come display
Mazes in black fire in the west
Shit is shakin its fly
Im in lookies when Im pushing vinyl time
Up the Fort where Im caught
And my thought to shakin up a few loose
Now I let my cause shoot KRS One
Cause we fade in and out are you swinging or coming
Im solid on this thought this aint living
Its heavy every setback even when I was a shorty
Now we catch you in your four thrice
Check me in another place space and joy
Nothing you could serve could ever
Ace me boy
Fat laces Im out fat and no babies
Thats right baby
Chorus
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right

Verse  Doodlebug
I got Harlem on my mind Darren on my back
Brooklyn in my blood and butters on the track
I got insect thoughts catch the cool ways
Clouds of purple haze keep me in a daze
The jazz the jive the poetry
The style the lingo the bags of equality
Many different things try to get to me
But in a world of hard rock I keep my humility
The funkanaut from the kingdom of not
With galactic sure shot they cant wont dont stop
Flock to the rhythm I bring
Sing songs call survival on the Mingus revival
Scored the bass hit with my bugged out clique
Its Doodlebug give me love for a visual script
Sip the groove juice its kind of rough
Sevens never bluff I had enough eleven
Chorus
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Verse  Butterfly
In the east I rose
Froze in the pose
Of a land diseased
Flows that cooler summer breeze
Nikki did Kevins braids we got four in the Lac
As we swoop at warp seven holler dont crowd cats
Cause look corpie is the color and Butter he do it low
All you hear is poppers and rubber Im saying oh
Man we keep it popping on hot days
Shit I got the fish eggs dropping any block you dip
And I dazzle that mood with the cool out fool
Easing semiswerve to the curb like the do
Im fro blow got that right
Groove with soul and Im still spinnin
Cross  and indicate them something else
Blackest space deepest sea
Scoff My shits a natural high the man cant put no thing on me
Now catch me when my mind stretch out its astro black
Time reaching into end nappy afro blue
We Swing fightin out the corners
Do my thaaang like Huey with it nigga
Chorus
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Thats right sho you right
Butterfly
The ticky ticky buzz the sun wakes the sky
I fumble through my fuzz and buzz Mr I
Tell him scoop the beats in the flying saucer kit
Meet me at the port with the nickel bags and shit
Tell my pops Im out earthbound with the crew
He said Butterfly may the boogie be with you
Left my moms a note with these quotes on a trunk
It says I split to Earth to resurrect the funk
A dozen Snapple pops and a little box of beats
Travelin through space with the funky funky beats
Stopped at Pluto to cop some petrol
Met some Klingons and got our things on
Cruisin warp  with Mr Wiggles in the mix
Hendrix passin peas star child get the fix
The saucer shook the heavens with the blooms and the blams
Because when we hit New York  shazam
We droppin like a comet and this Vulcan tried to Spock it
These martians tried to do it but knew they couldnt cop it
The others from our brother planet lands in the flesh
From up in sector  yes yall
Doodlebug
And its good to be here
When we landed up on lex
Stirrin up the ground with the sound of Doug E Fresh
And the hard rockin kids that did it for the black
With the Pumas on their feet and the bombers on their back
We learned it and we earned it so you know you got to hand it
We planned it when we left how to freak it and to slam it
Add a Ladybug transformation is complete
For the metamorphosis from the box to the Jeep
Ladybug
And its good to be here
Gettin fly with the raps
We love it where we from but we kick it where we at
Bumpin out with somethin that pops and transcends
Dps baby its slim but not thin
In amongst the pebbles we rocks on your blocks
Soakin in the ghetto for kids that have not
Slappin on some skin when we slam check the cheers
So we greet their virgin ears with a kiss
Its so good to be here
All
We jazz up the streets to prove we have beats
Fat jazz fat style and the sound so sweet
And there aint no doubt that you got to check
Doodle Silk Butter Mecc
Its so good to be here
Butterfly
Yeah baby thats the style
The jazz can fill a club or papers by the pile
Just ask toy soldier toy soldier could of told you
At the boomin funk hut it was the Afro with the butt
So to the flam lovers that crowd in dark spots
So see em kick the lingo and grip that little crotch
Now we have arrived with crazy boogie sounds
Get yourself a mate todays to boogie down
This is all we know we feel it when we slams
You could hear the love it comes out in our jams
The hiphop diggin cats just deliverin the words
From the ghettodwellin youth to the bourgies in the burbs
And its good to be here
Butterfly
DPS forever hit ya with the live stuff
Suliman the Bronx Ripper on the live puff
V Love thats my money like dominoes
Brooklyn do keep it rocking till the sun shows
I pop my junk my junk I pop my junk my junk
I pop my junk my junk Pop my junk my junk
I pop my junk my junk like what you want you want
Pop my junk my junk I pop my junk
The noise that we made is blue in color sound
Toys who played my crew couldnt walk the new ground
Or chalk the new sound
A bop like Teddy Charles was burning
When I excurse on excursions
Arriving at the doors of mind shores of seas
Burnt you with degrees solarly
Plus my leather jacket go acid disappear in the wisp
In the mist with a fist
Proletariat Cadilac steering it
Fro soul gold Panther crew grab our poppers
Now Im making bacon
Still saying wa ah salaam ah lakum
Fresh joints we make em like water
Butter rap treasures at my leisure whatever whatever
So I gave my mind a pound cause yall we had it down
We symbolize the blessed and represent the rest
Grabs in my pockets I release my hot rockets
KB said What you give em I was like Mad rhythm
Thats my junk
Ladybug Mecca
Eric Dolphy always hits me with the live stuff

Fossil watch fifth line still shining

See Marvin knew it and Sly knew it
Cube know it and now we do it outta Brooklyn
Outta sight brown sandals handlin MCs with angles
Commit to street corners where players be jayin

We vanish like vapor
Burn paper

We linger in the funk

The Honeybugs dug and licked the honey dew

The lips with the soul and some jazz for ya hips
The puff the buzz the lids be heavy slick
The Mecca get a rush when the beats be very thick
The hands the feet the brown baby treat
The femmes fumble loose and drink the doodlejuice
The steps the flams the Planets goddamn
The peoples get a grip with a tape from a jam

The lack of the funks the main why we came
The boogie gets done the colors wont run
The funk hits the square the kids gotta come
The pizza with the pop the west th stop
The crew after crew that do the grasshop
The true cool is black the new school is fat
The beats by the ounce the funk by the pack
The groove is the fix the jitterbugs fix
The hanging off the butts with the fat sole kicks

Hanging off the ave with the beautifulest naps
Ride in the crest with the blessed give a yes
Planets kinda funky as if you hadnt guessed
Placebos getting blocked funky joints get rocked
Jive is not found
We fly from the flesh
Whether Jeep or Lac
Peak you as you been there and float to them raps
Butterflys planets for the jam  Tracks
From the tops with the twists and plaits
Look beneath my hat
Find the braids that hit ya metro quite equipped
Knows of all the funk that was laid in seven zips
Funk is phat homey homey dont you know me
Cool is back give some skin lay it on me
Groovy you could call it

Check out the wares check out the hairs
Sweetback chills with Shaft on the ave
Jimmis digging cats and thats just the half
Whered they find the stuff to freak it like a wizard
Slick just like a lizard
Really weird or is it
Its just the logic from how we rocks it
Pop shock picks it up and drops its
We the synthesis of then and now melts
Channeled to the masses through a DJ and some felts
Long haired hippies Afro blacks
All get together across the tracks
Because when we shows up rhythm rolls up
Funk cannot be measured while the pleasure grows up
Life aint what it seems life is but a dream
Planets wreaking havoc is as constant as the rain
Yeah
Sample
The song is by some groovy cats
If you can dig
The cats you can dig the song
Yeah I can really dig how these cats get down with the
Sound as it is today
The way theyre bringing it all
Together theyre cool
Brothas are doin it right And
Theyre paying good respect to the masters
I can dig it
Exactly the way it should be
